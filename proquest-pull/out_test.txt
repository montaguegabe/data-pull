Increasing Pro-Environmental Behaviors by Increasing Self-Concordance:

Testing an Intervention

Kerrie L. Unsworth

Globally, there is a clear need to change our behavior to mitigate climate change. Many people, however,
will not find the need for mitigation important enough to make their behavior more environmentally
sustainable. Three studies supported the hypothesis that it is possible to overcome this issue by
connecting these behaviors to goals that are important to people, even if such goals are unrelated to
climate change or the environment in general. Study 1 (N ⫽ 305 working adults) showed that stronger
self-concordance of behavior related to energy sustainability was related to a greater chance of signing
a petition for increasing renewable energy sources. Next, 2 experimental studies (Study 2: N ⫽ 412
working and nonworking adults, and Study 3: N ⫽ 300 working adults) showed that increasing
self-concordance of environmentally sustainable behaviors by asking people to cognitively connect either
sustainable energy use (Study 2) or commuting behaviors (Study 3) to their personal goals increased
intentions to engage in these behaviors compared to a control condition (Study 2 and Study 3) and
compared to persuasion attempts based on climate change mitigation (Study 3). These findings occurred
even after controlling for political orientation and environmental concerns. This research has significant
practical implications for workplaces, particularly for those in which employees or managers place a low
priority on environmental and climate change considerations.

Despite protests by some, there is no doubt that the climate of
the world is changing (Parry, Canziani, Palutikof, van der Linden,
& Hanson, 2007; Australian Bureau of Meteorology, 2013; Peter-
son, Hoerling, Stott, & Herring, 2013) and that mitigation of this
change requires a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. This
necessitates an alteration of carbon emission related behaviors
such as switching to alternative, nonfossil-based energy sources,
reducing the general demand for energy and switching to public
transport rather than own-car usage (Barnett et al., 2011). In line
with this, the past decade has seen an increase in organizational
research examining how environmental sustainability can best be
improved through organizational processes such as corporate so-

cial responsibility strategies and human resource procedures (e.g.,
Aguilera, Rupp, Williams, & Ganapathi, 2007; Aguinis & Glavas,
2012, 2013; Andersson & Bateman, 2000; Andersson, Jackson, &
Russell, 2013; Bratton & Bratton, 2015; Davis & Coan, 2015;
Delmas & Pekovic, 2013; Jackson, Ones, & Dilchert, 2012; Nor-
ton, Zacher, & Ashkanasy, 2012, 2014). Although these mac-
rolevel changes are sometimes successful (e.g., Andersson, Shi-
varajan, & Blau, 2005) their effects are underwhelming (see
Young et al., 2015). This is likely because their effectiveness
largely depends on whether or not employees are willing to change
their behavior in line with these organizational-wide systems (Da-
vis, Leach, & Clegg, 2011) and unfortunately, organizational pro-
cedures aimed at increasing environmental sustainability are not
always followed by employees (Davis & Challenger, 2012, 2015).
This lack of employee engagement in environmentally sustainable
behaviors could be due to several factors, such as a mismatch with
personal values or beliefs (e.g., Stern, 2000), low priority of
sustainability within the organization leading to conflicting goals
(Unsworth, Dmitrieva, & Adriasola, 2013), or cynicism due to a
perceived mismatch between what the organization “says” and
what it “does” with regards to sustainability (Aguinis & Glavas,
2013). This has raised the need to increase our understanding of
how to overcome these barriers and increase employees’ perfor-
mance of environmentally sustainable behaviors.

The majority of research aimed at increasing individuals’ per-
formance of environmentally sustainable behaviors has generally
taken one of two approaches (for reviews of workplace interven-
tions, see Osbaldiston & Schott, 2012; Unsworth, 2015; Young et
al., 2015). First, studies based on psychological theories such as

SELF-CONCORDANCE AND PRO-ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIORS

89

Theory of Planned Behavior (e.g., Fielding, McDonald, & Louis,
2008), the Values-Beliefs-Norms model (e.g., Stern, 2000), Self-
Determination Theory (e.g., Pelletier, Tuson, Green-Demers, No-
els, & Beaton, 1998), or a normative or leadership approach (e.g.,
Andersson et al., 2005; Cialdini, 2003; Graves, Sarkis, & Zhu,
2013; Kim, Kim, Han, Jackson, & Ployhart, 2014; Walls & Hoff-
man, 2013) have aimed to motivate people by influencing their
environmental and altruistic values, perceived social and personal
norms related to environmentally sustainable behaviors, knowl-
edge of climate change, and attitudes toward the environment and
climate change (e.g., Bamberg & Moser, 2007; Black, Stern, &
Elworth, 1985; Dono, Webb, & Richardson, 2010; Fielding, Terry,
Masser, & Hogg, 2008; Han, Nieuwenhijsen, de Vries, Blokhuis,
& Schaefer, 2013; Stern, Dietz, & Guagnano, 1995; Sussman,
Greeno, Gifford, & Scannell, 2013). What these studies have in
common is their focus on explicitly working toward environmental
goals, in other words, motivating people to behave in environmen-
tally sustainable ways by convincing them to help the environment
(Unsworth, 2015). This, of course, seems like an obvious course of
action, particularly as motivation appears to be of great influence
on employee green behavior (Norton, Parker, Zacher, & Ashka-
nasy, 2015). Yet, not everyone is susceptible to techniques focused
on environmental goals.

It is human nature to devalue, disregard, or even act adversely to
information that is not in line with one’s own attitudes and goals
(e.g., Clark & Evans, 2014; Hart et al., 2009; Strickland, Taber, &
Lodge, 2011). Therefore, environmentally focused techniques will
be ineffective for those who refute that climate change is happen-
ing, who do not find environmental sustainability particularly
important, or whose political identities prime them for opposing
environmental policies and behaviors (see, e.g., Unsworth & Field-
ing, 2014). Importantly, the percentage of people falling in these
categories appears to be substantial. For example, a relatively
recent study among 1,001 Americans showed that 28% either did
not believe global warming was happening or did not believe
humans could reduce it, even if it was happening (Leiserowitz,
Maibach, & Roser-Renouf, 2009). Similarly, a large international
poll conducted in 2014 showed that 38% of Australians and 36%
of Americans agreed with the statement “I’m tired of the fuss that
is being made about the environment” and even larger percentages
(55% and 50%, respectively) agreed with the statement “The
government is just using environmental issues as an excuse to raise
taxes” (Ipsos MORI, 2014). Moreover, even in the absence of
conflicting attitudes or beliefs, environmental goals may conflict
with the person’s privacy goals within the organization (Bol-
derdijk, Steg, & Postmes, 2013) or the organization’s goals, lead-
ing to less engagement in organizational interventions with a
pro-environmental focus (Unsworth et al., 2013).

The second research approach to influencing behavior comes
from an economics, human factors or behavioral finance perspec-
tive and often uses rewards or compliance strategies to increase
environmentally sustainable behaviors (e.g., Midden, Meter,
Weening, & Zieverink, 1983; Slavin, Wodarski, & Blackburn,
1981; Stern, 2011; Thøgersen & Moller, 2008). Yet this extrinsic-
motivators-based research too has had problems. For one, the
effect of rewards does not last a long time (Slavin et al., 1981;
Thøgersen & Moller, 2008). Furthermore, using compliance strat-
egies can backfire and result in rebound effects (Berkhout, Mus-
kens, & Velthuijsen, 2000; Greening, Greene, & Difiglio, 2000;

Schipper & Grubb, 1998). In sum, these two approaches have
provided mixed effects at best (see Osbaldiston & Schott, 2012;
Young et al., 2015).

We propose a third approach to influencing environmentally
sustainable behavior, which is based on goal hierarchy (Cropan-
zano, James, & Citera, 1993; Unsworth, Adriasola, Johnston-
Billings, Dmitrieva, & Hodkiewicz, 2011; Unsworth, Yeo, &
Beck, 2014) and goal systems (Kruglanski et al., 2002) theories.
This type of approach was first suggested by Rupp, Williams, and
Aguilera (2011). It allows the individual to choose to engage in the
environmentally sustainable behaviors autonomously (so as to
avoid the negative effects of extrinsic motivation) but is flexible in
the goals that are chosen as outcomes of the behaviors (so as to
avoid problems based on having no interest in the suggested goal).
More specifically, we suggest that increasing the degree to which
environmentally sustainable behaviors serve the person’s own
preexisting values, identities, and long-term goals, also referred to
as the behaviors’ self-concordance (Sheldon & Elliot, 1999), will
result in more widespread engagement in these behaviors, provid-
ing organizations with greater means for adapting to and mitigat-
ing against climate change. We propose that this will occur even
after controlling for related factors such as environmental concerns
and political ideology. In the following sections, we will introduce
both the theoretical background to our approach, as well as the
empirical findings that served as a basis for the development of our
hypotheses and self-concordance based intervention. Next, we will
present a time-lagged correlational study and two experiments that
test this intervention.

Theoretical Underpinnings of Self-Concordance

The premise of self-concordance is based on the notion of a goal
hierarchy (Cropanzano et al., 1993; Unsworth et al., 2011; Un-
sworth et al., 2014). A goal hierarchy, or goal system (see Figure
1), comprises all of a person’s values (e.g., power, creativity),
identities (e.g., leader, teacher, researcher), long-term goals (e.g.,
publishing a paper), and day-to-day behaviors and tasks (e.g.,
answering emails); these include both work and home values,
identities, goals, and tasks (Austin & Vancouver, 1996; Unsworth
et al., 2014). Moreover, there are connections between these levels
that can be facilitative or inhibitive (Kruglanski et al., 2002;
Unsworth et al., 2014). For example, the connection between a
particular behavior and a long-term goal
is facilitative if the
behavior helps to achieve the goal. As a result of this connection,
activation of one (i.e., wanting to achieve either the behavior or
goal) will result in activation of the other. Contrarily, the connec-
tion between a behavior and a goal is inhibitive if the behavior is
perceived as impeding progress toward the goal or vice versa:
Where such inhibitive connections exist, activation of one will lead
to suppression of the other (Kruglanski et al., 2002; Unsworth et
al., 2014).

For example, Figure 1 portrays a section of an academic’s goal
hierarchy. This academic might see “working on statistical analy-
ses” as having a facilitative connection to his goal of getting an
article published and to his identity as a researcher; thus, this
behavior is likely to be activated whenever his publishing goal or
researcher identity is activated. On the other hand, the academic
might view that same behavior as hindering progress toward his
teaching goal; the teaching goal is therefore likely to be inhibited

(or “forgotten”; Shah, Friedman, & Kruglanski, 2002) whenever
the academic is working on statistical analyses. With regard to
environmental behavior, this person might perceive the day-to-day
task of turning off office lights as connected to his teaching goal
because by doing so he teaches his students in that class about
pro-environmental workplace behaviors.

Self-concordance is the motivational propensity that derives
from the degree to which a particular behavior is connected in this
way to the rest of the person’s goal hierarchy. Self-concordance
between a behavior and higher-order goals (that is, all goals that
are higher in the goal hierarchy than the focal behavior) tends to be
calculated as the combination of two factors, namely (a) the degree
to which a particular behavior has more positive, facilitative con-
nections and fewer negative, inhibitory connections with a per-
son’s higher-order goals and (b) the personal importance of these
higher-order goals to which the connections are made (Adriasola,
Steele, Day, & Unsworth, 2011; Adriasola & Unsworth, 2011;
Adriasola, Unsworth, & Day, 2012; Sheldon & Emmons, 1995;
Sheldon & Kasser, 1995). Thus, self-concordance does not denote
particular higher-order goals as important for everyone, in contrast
to, for example, self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985).
Instead, it takes a broader perspective and, rather than a one-size-
fits-all approach, it is left to the individual to determine which
goals are important to him or her self. Self-concordance is theo-
rized to increase the motivation toward the specified behavior
based on both a utilitarian approach (the behavior that helps to
achieve the highest number of important higher-order goals pro-
vides more “bang for the buck” and thus more motivational power)
and a self-consistency approach (a behavior that helps to achieve
more higher-order goals is more easily regulated and enables
personality integration and positive well-being; Kruglanski et al.,
2013; Sheldon & Kasser, 1995).

Importantly, the connections between behaviors and higher-
order goals are supposed to be malleable such that they can be
activated or deactivated, and strengthened or weakened, depending
upon situational circumstances and learning (Hanges, Lord, &
Dickson, 2000; Lord & Brown, 2001; Unsworth et al., 2014). For
example, in Figure 1 the self-concordance of turning off office
lights is weak to moderate because it has a facilitative connection
to one goal (i.e., teaching) and no inhibitive connections. However,
if the academic realizes that turning off office lights can be used as

a behavioral measure for his research into workplace pro-
environmental behavior, his previous nonexistent relationship be-
tween turning off office lights and his research goal might be
changed to facilitative and his self-concordance for turning off
office lights will, consequently, increase. This is an example of
how self-concordance can be theoretically increased using a per-
son’s existing goals, without this person needing to have a goal,
identity or value focusing on environmental consideration or cli-
mate change. Thus, because self-concordance provides a motiva-
tional propensity to act regardless of the specific content of the
higher-order goals, the malleability of connections between behav-
iors and goals could provide a means of increasing the perfor-
mance of environmentally sustainable behaviors not only in those
who hold environmental goals, but also in cases where the goal of
“helping the environment” is seen as controversial or workplace-
irrelevant.

Empirical Evidence for Effects of Self-Concordance

the principle of

Empirically, self-concordance has been related to motivation
toward and engagement in behaviors in a variety of domains, such
as work-related performance (Bono & Judge, 2003; Molina, Un-
sworth, Hodkiewicz, & Adriasola, 2013), citizenship behaviors
(Greguras & Diefendorff, 2010), leader behaviors (Adriasola et al.,
2011), freshman adjustment behaviors (Sheldon & Houser-Marko,
2001), and planning for natural hazards (McNeill, Dunlop, Skin-
ner, & Morrison, 2015). However,
self-
concordance has not yet been empirically tested in relation to
environmentally sustainable behaviors, which is distinct from the
behaviors tested in previous studies. More specifically, the behav-
iors in previous studies that have examined the role of self-
concordance have all had direct connections with egocentric goals
(e.g., work-related performance helps with personal appraisals, the
performance of adjustment behaviors helps with personal coping,
the performance of planning behaviors helps with personal sur-
vival in the face of a hazard). Environmentally sustainable behav-
iors, on the other hand are generally seen as having consequences
for society at large, rather than just the individual. In addition, their
consequences tend to have a much longer time-frame relative to
the consequences of behaviors that normally occur in an organi-
zation (Bansal & Knox-Hayes, 2013). It might be that the distance

in goals (personal consequences compared to societal conse-
quences) and time-frame of the consequences alter the role played
by self-concordance. As such, we cannot directly generalize the
findings from previous research.

Still,

there are some research findings that suggest self-
concordance plays a similar role in predicting behavior in the
context of environmental sustainability as it does in relation to
behaviors that tend to be solely connected to egocentric goals.
First, Myers, Nisbet, Maibach, and Leiserowitz (2012) tested the
effect of three different message frames on U.S. citizens’ emo-
tional reactions to climate change information. These messages
framed climate change as a risk to the environment, public health,
or national security. They found that the frame that engendered
emotions that were most supportive of climate change mitigation
across different audiences was around public health. Second, Bain,
Hornsey, Bongiorno, and Jeffries (2012) looked specifically at
climate change skeptics and attempted to influence their willing-
ness to engage in environmental citizenship behaviors (sustainable
behaviors focused specifically on voluntary tasks) by asking them
to what extent they thought such behaviors would serve interper-
sonal warmth, societal development or a reduction of climate
change induced hazards. They found that asking skeptics to relate
environmental citizenship behaviors to interpersonal warmth or
societal development led to greater intentions to engage in the
behaviors than asking them to relate these behaviors to a reduction
in environmental hazards. We suggest that both sets of findings
can be explained by differences in self-concordance. More specif-
ically, most people would hold public health,
interpersonal
warmth, and societal development as higher-order goals; activating
the connection between environmental behaviors and these goals is
therefore likely to increase the self-concordance of these behaviors
for people regardless of their views on climate change. In contrast,
activation of the goal of reducing climate change related risks is
more likely to have been in conflict with the personal attitudes and
goals of the respondents, given that the first study was conducted
among U.S. citizens, many of whom hold attitudes and goals in
conflict with goals related to climate change (Ipsos MORI, 2014;
Leiserowitz et al., 2009), and the second study was run among
climate change skeptics, all of whom are likely to hold conflicting
attitudes and goals to a certain degree. Given the higher likelihood
of goal conflict, the climate change-related conditions would not
have increased self-concordance in as many cases.

The findings from previous research are thus in line with the
idea that self-concordance plays a role in the context of environ-
mentally sustainable behaviors. However, neither of these studies
explicitly measured self-concordance of the sustainable behaviors.
In addition, no study to date, neither within the domain of envi-
ronmentally sustainable behaviors nor in relation to other behav-
iors has explicitly focused on influencing behavior by manipulat-
ing self-concordance. Furthermore,
the studies that may have
influenced intentions or behavior by increasing self-concordance,
albeit without measuring it (e.g., Bain et al., 2012), have asked
respondents to create a connection between the target behavior and
one specific higher order goal. Because the self-concordance of a
behavior is based on what each individual considers his or her own
important goals, the manipulation of self-concordance should ide-
ally include the possibility of creating connections with a variety
of goals that people might find personally important, rather than
prescribing a connection to a single goal.

We thus set out to expand on past research in two important
ways. First, we wanted to test our theorizing that there is a
relationship between the self-concordance of environmentally sus-
tainable behaviors on the one hand and intentions to perform and
actual performance of such behaviors on the other. Based on our
previous argument we believe this is the case. Therefore, we
hypothesized that:

Hypothesis 1: There will be a positive relationship between
self-concordance of environmentally sustainable behavior and
both intentions to perform and actual performance of environ-
mentally sustainable behavior.

Second, based on our theorizing, we believe that encouraging
people to create facilitative connections between environmentally
sustainable behavior and the goals that are important to them will
increase the self-concordance of these behaviors and, as a result,
increase people’s intentions to engage in these behaviors. Thus, we
hypothesize that:

Hypothesis 2a: Persuading people to create connections be-
tween environmentally sustainable behaviors (namely, sus-
tainable energy use and commuting) and their higher-order
goals will be associated with an increase in intentions to
engage in these sustainable behaviors.

Hypothesis 2b: The relationship between the self-concordance
intervention and intentions to perform environmentally sus-
tainable behaviors will be mediated by perceived self-
concordance of these behaviors.

We tested these hypotheses in three complementary studies. The
first was a temporally lagged study of working adults, which tested
the relationship between self-concordance of environmentally sus-
tainable energy behavior and a behavioral measure of increasing
environmentally sustainable use of energy by signing a petition.
The next two studies were experimental surveys in nonstudent
samples that incorporated our newly developed self-concordance
manipulation: One examined the effects of the self-concordance
manipulation on intentions to engage in environmentally sustain-
able energy behaviors compared to a control condition while the
other compared the effects of the self-concordance manipulation
on intentions to engage in environmentally sustainable ways of
commuting to work with both a traditional climate change manip-
ulation and a control condition. These three studies complement
each other both theoretically and methodologically. Theoretically,
Study 1 takes a static, individual differences approach whereas
Studies 2 and 3 examine the dynamic and malleable nature of
self-concordance. Methodologically, Studies 2 and 3 provide
causal evidence that builds on the correlational evidence of Study
1, whereas Study 1 uses an actual behavioral measure that com-
plements the intentions measures in Studies 2 and 3.

UNSWORTH AND MCNEILL

a small cash or noncash payment of approximately AU$6 for each
survey [AU$18 per hour] from Qualtrics for doing so) received
two surveys spread 1 month apart to decrease the likelihood of
cross-sectional response biases. The first wave of data collection
received 528 complete responses (260 males and 266 females;
⫽ 45.57, SD ⫽ 16.13). The second wave of data collection
Mage
received 305 complete responses (148 males and 157 females,
⫽ 47.35 years, SD ⫽ 15.62 years). Combining all data across
Mage
both waves of data collection, we were able to match 303 re-
sponses across the two time periods (57.4% response rate at time
two).

Measures and Procedure

Self-concordance. Self-concordance of environmentally sus-
tainable use of energy was measured in the first wave of data
collection. Its measurement was based on Adriasola and col-
leagues’ operationalization (Adriasola et al., 2011; Adriasola &
Unsworth, 2011; Adriasola et al., 2012) which, in turn, was based
on Sheldon and Kasser (1995). Sheldon and Kasser (1995) asked
participants to rate how helpful everyday strivings were to six
idealized futures, and then summed the resulting scores to get a
measure of overarching self-concordance. Adriasola and col-
leagues modified this by focusing on self-concordance for one
striving or behavior (in our case, energy behavior), by increasing
the number of potential goals/futures to incorporate all relevant
values and goals (see below) and by allowing each participant to
indicate how important the idealized futures or values (in our case,
goals) were to them; the helpfulness score was then weighted by
the importance score. The importance weights thus allowed the
goals that are important to an individual to play a bigger role in
determining self-concordance than goals that are seen as irrelevant
by the individual. Adding such importance weights is essential
from a theoretical point of view because the self-concordance
concept is based around a person’s individual goals, rather than
assuming all people hold the same goals. As the measure is
essentially an index, measuring internal reliability is not appropri-
ate (Cronbach & Gleser, 1953). However, Adriasola and col-
leagues have found this measure, when applied to leadership
behavior (Adriasola et al., 2011; Adriasola & Unsworth, 2011) or
work task behaviors (Adriasola et al., 2012), to have convergent
validity with an older conceptualization of self-concordance and
predictive validity with the specific behaviors over time.

Thus, we first asked participants to rate how important 12
different goals were to them on a 5-point scale (from 1 “Not at all
important” to 5 “Very important”). These goals were based on the
full set of egoistic, altruistic, and biospheric values (Schwartz,
1992; Schwartz, 1994; Stern, 2000; Stern & Dietz, 1994) as well
as additional pro-environmental behavior motives (De Young,
2000); they were financial goals, frugality, not standing out from
the crowd, being helpful to others, protecting the environment,
participating in changing the world, social justice, fulfilling re-
quirements and obligations, being a good citizen/neighbor, looking
after our children’s future, having a relatively easy or convenient
life, and reducing the effects of climate change. Next, to determine
the strength and valence of the connections between environmen-
tally sustainable energy behavior and their higher-order goals we
obtained ratings for how much participants believed that environ-
mentally sustainable energy use would help them to achieve each
of the 12 goals. The responses were rated on a 7-point scale
ranging from 1 (very unhelpful [detrimental]) to 7 (very helpful).
We calculated weighted self-concordance scores for environmen-
tally sustainable use of energy by creating a weighted helpfulness
score (i.e., helpfulness in achieving goal A ⫻ importance of goal
A ⫹ helpfulness in achieving goal B ⫻ importance of goal B . . .
and so on). Self-concordance scores were thus able to range from
12 to 420. As shown in Table 1, and consistent with Adriasola and
colleagues’ research, in our study energy self-concordance was
significantly correlated with climate change beliefs (r ⫽ .22) and
environmental identity (r ⫽ .49), indicating convergent validity;
but was not correlated with broader attitudes such as political
orientation (r ⫽ .02), indicating divergent validity.

Support for sustainable energy. To capture a behavioral
measure related to environmentally sustainable use of energy we
told participants at the end of wave two that they could be involved
in signing petitions that we were sending to the Federal Govern-
ment Minister (see, e.g., Margetts, John, Escher, & Reissfelder,
2011; Schumann & Klein, 2015). We made a clear separation
between the survey questions and the petitions to decrease survey
biases.

Participants were offered the opportunity to sign two petitions,
each representing different sides of the environmental debate to
decrease social desirability biases. The first petition served as our
measure related to environmentally sustainable use of energy. This
was a petition in support of transitioning Australia to 100% re-

newable energy. The second petition served the purpose of de-
creasing social desirability to sign the sustainable energy petition
and was a petition in support of scrapping the carbon tax. The
carbon tax was a controversial policy that had been implemented
by the government at the time to aid in the reduction of carbon
pollution. Although generally supported by those holding pro-
environmental values, it was strongly contested by the opposition.
Signing the second petition, scrapping the carbon tax, could be
interpreted as anti-environmental behavior. However, because the
tax was based on carbon pollution, which stems not only from
energy use, but also from other factors such as manufacturing
processes, this petition lacked a particular focus on sustainable use
of energy. Participants were free to sign either petition or to refrain
from signing either or both petitions. Both petitions were created
using the rhetoric and wording identified in websites aimed at each
viewpoint. For each petition, participants were told,

You can decide how much your level of involvement is by (a) not
signing the petition; (b) signing the petition and having the standard
text provided; (c) signing the petition and altering the text to make the
message more personal to you; or (d) signing the petition and writing
your own personal message attached to your petition.

Of the 305 respondents in the second wave, 181 answered the
petition question that was our dependent variable construct (i.e.,
environmentally sustainable use of energy; 59.3%). Of these,
29.3% of those respondents responded that they were not inter-
ested in signing the renewable energy petition, 65.7% signed using
the standard text, 2.8% signed and modified the text, whereas 2.2%
signed and created new text. Because of the skewedness in the
responses, we combined the latter three responses to represent
signing the renewable energy petition as our main variable; thus,
the measure split the sample into those who signed the renewable
energy pro-environmental petition (“2”) and those who indicated
they were not interested in signing the petition (“1”). As expected,
signing versus not signing this petition was unrelated to whether or
not participants signed the second petition, r ⫽ ⫺.06, p ⫽ .77.

Control variables.

It is important to note that demographics
and environmental goals at a range of levels of abstraction have
been related to engagement in environmentally sustainable behav-
ior in the past: This includes free-market ideology at the broadest
level of abstraction (e.g., Heath & Gifford, 2006; Lewandowsky,
Gignac, & Vaughan, 2013), environmental identity at a medium
level (e.g., Fielding, McDonald et al., 2008; Fielding, Terry, et al.,
2008; Sparks & Shepherd, 1992) and beliefs in anthropogenic
climate change at the most specific level of abstraction (e.g., Bord,
O’Connor, & Fisher, 2000; Gifford, 2011; Leviston & Walker,
2012). Because the self-concordance of sustainable behaviors is
partially based on the relationships these behaviors may have with
environmental goals, we wanted to rule out the possibility that it is
these relationships with environmental goals that are driving the
behaviors, rather than the overall self-concordance, and thus we
need to control for these variables.

To capture free-market ideology, we included the measure by
Heath and Gifford (2006), which asks participants to indicate the
extent to which they agree with five statements (e.g., “The pres-
ervation of the free market system is more important than localized
environmental concerns”) on a 5-point scale ranging from 1
(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree; ␣ ⫽ .75). This measure
was included in Wave 2. We captured the strength of a partici-

pant’s environmental identity in the first wave of data-collection
with the three item measure by Fielding, McDonald et al. (2008;
e.g., “I think of myself as an environmentally-conscious person”).
The items were measured on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (very
strongly disagree) to 9 (very strongly agree). Cronbach’s alpha for
this sample was .94, indicating strong internal reliability. Finally,
to control for climate change beliefs, we included the one-item
measure developed by the Australian Commonwealth Scientific
and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO; Leviston &
Walker, 2011) in the first wave survey. The question has been
shown by Greenhill, Leviston, Leonard, and Walker (2014) to be
the most valid of the current measures of climate change beliefs; it
asks participants to choose the statement that best describes their
general attitude toward climate change. The statements range from
1 (lack of belief in climate change; “I do not believe in climate
change”), 2 (through lack of knowledge; “I do not know whether
climate change is happening or not”), 3 (through to belief in
nonanthropogenic climate change; “I believe that climate change is
happening but it’s just a natural fluctuation in Earth’s tempera-
tures”), 4 (through to belief in anthropogenic climate change; “I
believe that climate change is happening and humans are contrib-
uting to it”).

We also measured age, gender, and political orientation in the
first wave, becaue previous research has found that they affect the
performance of environmentally sustainable behaviors with
younger, female and more left-wing-oriented people engaging in a
greater number of environmentally sustainable behaviors (e.g.,
Yue, Long, & Chen, 2013). Political orientation was dichotomized
into “left-wing-oriented” (Labor Party, Greens Party) and “right-
wing-oriented” (Liberal Party, Nationals Party). For international
reference, at the time the study was conducted, the Australian
Labor Party was most similar in orientation to the U.K. Labor
Party and the U.S. Democrats, the Greens Party was most similar
to the U.K. Greens Party, and the Liberal and Nationals Parties
were most similar to the U.S. mainstream conservatives. Those
who aligned with Independents were not included in the analysis
as they supported single-issue candidates rather than being ideo-
logically driven.

Results

Table 1 outlines the means, standard deviations and correlations
between the variables. We first ran a logistic regression analysis
with signing behavior related to the pro-environmental petition on
renewable energy as the dependent variable. This analysis, shown
in Table 2, showed that the total model was significantly related to
renewable energy petition signing behavior (␹2 ⫽ 40.03, df ⫽ 7,
p ⬍ .001; Cox & Snell R2 ⫽ .24). Most
importantly, self-
concordance of environmentally sustainable energy use was sig-
nificantly positively associated with the likelihood of signing the
renewable energy petition (B ⫽ .012, SE ⫽ .005, Wald statistic ⫽
7.22, p ⫽ .007); the odds ratio was 1.012 (95% confidence interval
[CI] ⫽ 1.003–1.12). As expected, political orientation had a sig-
nificant relationship with petition behavior (B ⫽ 1.11, SE ⫽ .48,
Wald statistic ⫽ 5.41, p ⫽ .020), however neither gender nor age
was significantly related to it (B ⫽ ⫺.16, SE ⫽ .48, Wald statis-
tic ⫽ 0.11, p ⫽ .74; B ⫽ .01, SE ⫽ .02, Wald statistic ⫽ 0.53,

Standard error

The next study tested for causality within the relationship between
self-concordance of environmentally sustainable use of energy and
the intention to engage in environmentally sustainable energy
behaviors (Hypothesis 2). In this study, we randomly assigned
participants to an experimental and control group, increased self-
concordance of the environmentally sustainable use of energy in
the experimental group and then tested for differences in the
intention to engage in environmentally sustainable energy behav-
iors.

Sample

A sample of Australian adults from an accredited panel organi-
zation (Qualtrics) was used to test our experimental hypothesis.
Five hundred and seven participants opted-in and completed the
survey for a small payment of approximately AU$6 (AU$24 per
hour) or its equivalent in noncash payment made by Qualtrics;
none of these participants had participated in Study One. Approx-
imately half the participants (51.5%) were female and they came
from a range of educational backgrounds (32.1% junior or high
school; 36.7% had a technical qualification; 22.3% had a bache-
lor’s degree; and 8.9% had a Masters or PhD), and political
orientations (34.0% aligned with center-left Labor Party; 37.9%
with conservative Liberal Party; 4.9% with the conservative Na-
tionals Party; 7.7% with the left-wing Greens Party; and 15.6%
with Independents).

Measures and Procedure

Manipulation. Of the 507 participants who completed the
survey, 256 were randomly allocated to the experimental self-
concordance condition and 251 to the control condition. Partici-
pants in the control condition were not encouraged to identify
connections between environmentally sustainable energy behav-
iors and higher-order goals. In the self-concordance condition
however, we aimed to increase the perceived connections between
energy environmentally sustainable energy behaviors and the per-
son’s important goals. Thus, after completing the section contain-
ing the control variables and demographics, participants in the
experimental condition were told a number of ways in which
environmentally sustainable behaviors can help to achieve goals
other than environmental ones:

Sometimes, people think that dealing with climate change means that
you have to make sacrifices or that you will not be able to achieve
your goals. But, recently, it’s been shown that behaviors such as
recycling, energy and water efficiency, careful use of transportation
and so forth have a number of other benefits. For example, did you
know that
(cid:129) Turning off lights, changing your air-conditioner settings and other

energy efficient behaviors helps you to save money.

(cid:129) Commuting to work can give you time to catch up on your emails

or allows you time to read or listen to audio-books.

(cid:129) Being careful with your waste means that less plastic ends up in the
oceans and we have cleaner beaches and healthier sea-life and
bird-life so that you can enjoy your holidays more.

(cid:129) A number of environmentally friendly products are also socially
responsible, meaning that fewer people in third-world countries are
being exploited.

(cid:129) Walking and cycling instead of driving means that there are fewer

cars on the road and fewer accidents.

Wald statistic ⫽ 2.26, p ⫽ .13; B ⫽ ⫺.72, SE ⫽ .37, Wald

self-concordance (r ⫽ .22, p ⬍ .001; r ⫽ .49, p ⬍ .001; r ⫽ ⫺.06,
p ⫽ .36; respectively) indicating the more proximal effect of
self-concordance.

The 124 respondents who did not answer the pro-environmental
petition question could be labeled as being unwilling to sign the
petition. To investigate this possibility we first conducted a t test
between respondents and nonrespondents: There were no signifi-
cant differences in their level of self-concordance of environmen-
tally sustainable energy use, t ⫽ .13, df ⫽ 476, p ⫽ .72. Next, to
ensure that the findings of the logistic regression analysis reported
above were robust, we reran the logistic regression but included
nonrespondents as nonpetition-signers. Again, the total model was
significantly related to renewable energy petition behavior (␹2 ⫽
41.34, df ⫽ 7, p ⬍ .001; Cox & Snell R2 ⫽ .17) and self-
concordance of sustainable energy use was significantly positively
associated with the likelihood of signing the petition on renewable

odds ratio was 1.01 (95% CI ⫽ 1.002–1.14).

Next, we ran the four additional regression models, namely with
or without nonresponders, and either without any controls or with
only the demographic control variables. In all four logistic regres-
sions, self-concordance of environmentally sustainable energy use
was significantly positively associated with the likelihood of sign-
ing the renewable energy petition (B ⫽ .011, SE ⫽ .003, Wald
statistic ⫽ 11.48, p ⫽ .001; B ⫽ .005, SE ⫽ .002, Wald statistic ⫽

respectively). Thus, the results of this first study were robust and
supported Hypothesis 1.

Study 2

The first study showed a relationship over time between the
self-concordance of environmentally sustainable use of energy and
the behavioral measure of signing a petition for renewable energy.

SELF-CONCORDANCE AND PRO-ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIORS

95

To encourage participants in the experimental condition to iden-
tify personal connections between behaviors and their own goals,
we then asked them: “What are some ways in which behaviors
such as recycling, energy and water efficiency, careful use of
transportation and so on could help you to achieve your goals?”
Participants responded in a text box below this question, which
served as a manipulation check. Any blank responses or responses
such as “You tell me” or “Don’t know” were considered to
represent people not attending to the manipulation and, as such,
were deleted from further analysis. Responses from 53 people in
the experimental condition were deleted through these manipula-
tion checks. To further ensure data validity we deleted any partic-
ipant in either condition who completed the survey in less than 8
min (the quickest time that a nonblind research assistant could
complete the control condition). Eighteen participants in the ex-
perimental condition and 24 participants in the control condition
were deemed to have completed the survey so quickly that they
could not have participated properly in the study. Thus, 412
participants remained in the study; 240 in the control condition and
172 in the experimental condition.

To check that the people who did not participate were not
different to those who did, we ran some checks. Those who
completed the manipulation in the experimental condition did not
differ from those who did not complete the manipulation in age,
t ⫽ .54, df ⫽ 249, p ⫽ .59 or education level (t ⫽ ⫺.25, df ⫽ 248,
p ⫽ .80). However, there were differences in gender with those
completing the manipulation being more likely to be female than
male (t ⫽ 2.07, df ⫽ 249, p ⫽ .040); and differences in environ-
mental values, with those completing the manipulation placing a
higher value on the environment than those who did not (t ⫽ 2.69,
df ⫽ 249, p ⫽ .002). However, when comparing those who
completed the manipulation in the experimental condition to the
participants in the control group, no significant differences were
found on either gender, t ⫽ .04, df ⫽ 410, p ⫽ .97 or environ-
mental values (t ⫽ ⫺1.39, df ⫽ 410, p ⫽ .17). Thus, these
differences are unlikely to have affected the results. Among the
remaining participants, the vast majority of open-ended responses
to the self-concordance intervention were focused on environmen-
tally sustainable energy behaviors therefore we focused on this as
the key environmental domain for this study.

Measures

Sustainable energy use intentions. To measure intentions to
engage in sustainable energy behaviors, we created a scale based
on four items from a CSIRO measure of pro-environmental be-
havior (Leviston & Walker, 2011; Leviston, Walker, & Morwin-
ski, 2013). The original scale consists of 11 items covering a wide
range of environmentally sustainable behaviors. Participants indi-
cated the extent to which they intend to perform these behaviors in
the next few weeks and months and responded on a 5-point scale
from 1 (not at all) to 5 (a great deal). We calculated the mean
score across the following four items that focused on sustainable
energy behaviors: (a) “Use or switch to appliances that are envi-
ronmentally-friendly;” (b) “Reduce the amount of gas and/or elec-
tricity I use around the house;” (c) “Turn lights off around the
house;” and (d) “Continue to have or switch to Green Power
Electricity.” The internal reliability of the 4-item scale in this
sample was adequate (␣ ⫽ .73).

Self-concordance. Our measure of self-concordance was the

same as that for Study 1.

Control variables. The demographic characteristics of age,
gender, education level, and political orientation were again mea-
sured. As in Study 1, political orientation was dichotomized into
“left-wing-oriented” (Labor Party, Greens Party) and “right-wing-
oriented” (Liberal Party, Nationals Party); again Independents
were not included in the analysis as they tend to support single-
issue candidates rather than being ideologically driven. Also,
rather than measuring lower-level environmental goals or specific
attitudes, we decided to control for environmental values at its
broadest, and thus most widely influential,
level; participants
therefore rated the importance of “protecting the environment” to
them on a scale from 1 (not at all important) to 5 (very important).
Finally, to control for social desirability we used the self-deception
subscale from the Environmental Social Desirability Scale (Ewert
& Galloway, 2009). This subscale contains six items (e.g., “I know
what actions I should take regarding how best to protect the
environment”) rated on a 4-point scale from 1 (does not describe
me at all) to 4 (describes me very well). The scale demonstrated a
good internal reliability (␣ ⫽ .74).

Results

To check that the self-concordance manipulation was affecting
a variety of goals, and not simply environmental goals, we exam-
ined the data in two ways. First, when looking at the open-ended
responses generated by the self-concordance manipulation, we
found that the majority of responses were oriented toward financial
goals (51 responses), with climate change or environmental goals
being the other big set of goals related to energy behavior (37
responses).1 Interestingly, although many people discussed finan-
cial goals, these were not always strictly egoistic with many people
talking about using money for other reasons, for example, “Saving
money so I can spoil my kids.” Furthermore, although many
participants combined nonenvironmental goals with environmental
goals (e.g., “Saves me money plus doing my bit to protect the
environment”), others saw a difference between these (e.g., “I
think any of the above methods would be beneficial to you, either
health or financial wise, but as to the climate changing factors, I
am not convinced that it is a major problem”).

Second, we compared the strength of connections between en-
vironmentally sustainable energy use and each specific goal across
experimental and control groups. As shown in Table 3, the ma-
nipulation acted as expected and had broad effects: There were
significant differences not only for the connection between sus-
tainable energy use and environmentally related goals (helping the
environment, climate change, looking after our children’s future)
but also between sustainable energy use and nonenvironmentally
related goals (financial goals, having an easy life, being a good
citizen and activism). Thus, we feel confident
the self-
concordance manipulation is not simply tapping into the connec-

that

1 Not everybody referred to their goal in their response and often just
discussed what they would do rather than how it would help their goals. On
the other hand, some people reported as many as three goals that their
actions would help to achieve. As such, the numbers reported here do not
add up to the total number of responses and are indicative rather than
inferential.

tion between the environmentally sustainable use of energy and
participants’ environmental goals.

Table 4 outlines the means, standard deviations, and correlations
between the variables studied. A t test comparing intentions to
engage in environmentally sustainable energy behaviors across the
experimental and control conditions was significant (t ⫽ 2.32,
df ⫽ 410, p ⫽ .021) with means in the self-concordance condition
(M ⫽ 3.46, SD ⫽ .97) being higher than those in the control
condition (M ⫽ 3.23, SD ⫽ 1.03). Furthermore, a t test comparing
self-concordance across the experimental and control conditions
was also significant (t ⫽ 2.01, df ⫽ 410, p ⫽ .045); again, the
⫽ 262.34, SD ⫽
means were in the expected direction (Mexpt
⫽ 247.17, SD ⫽ 77.84). The effect sizes, as measured
72.57; Mcon
by Cohen’s d, were d ⫽ .23 and .20, respectively, which is similar
to Study 1.

We next tested a regression model to examine the unique role
that self-concordance of environmentally sustainable use of energy
played in accounting for variance in intentions to engage in envi-
ronmentally sustainable energy behaviors. Even after controlling
for age, gender, education level, political orientation, social desir-
ability, and environmental values, self-concordance still accounted
for a significant amount of variance in intentions to engage in
environmentally sustainable energy behaviors (see Table 5). Ro-
bustness checks with various combinations of control variables
indicated consistent effects for self-concordance (with no control
variables, B ⫽ .01, SE ⫽ .001, p ⬍ .001; with demographic
variables only, B ⫽ .01, SE ⫽ .001, p ⬍ .001; with environmental
values and social desirability only, B ⫽ .01, SE ⫽ .001, p ⬍ .001),
thus supporting Hypothesis 2a.

Finally, to test our specific hypothesized mediation from Hy-
pothesis 2b we used the bootstrapping procedures outlined by
Preacher and Hayes (2004, 2008). Results of the analysis revealed
that the self-concordance manipulation had a significant effect on
self-concordance of environmentally sustainable use of energy
(B ⫽ 15.17, SE ⫽ 7.56, p ⫽ .046), which in turn had a significant
effect on intentions to engage in environmentally sustainable en-
ergy behaviors (B ⫽ .01, SE ⬍ .01, p ⬍ .001). The total effect
between the self-concordance manipulation and intentions to en-
gage in environmentally sustainable energy behaviors was signif-
icant (B ⫽ .23, SE ⫽ .10, p ⫽ .021) and the model accounted for

37% of the variance in intentions to engage in environmentally
sustainable energy behaviors. As expected, and supporting a full
mediation hypothesis,
the direct effect between the self-
concordance manipulation and intentions to engage in environ-
mentally sustainable energy behaviors was nonsignificant when
self-concordance of environmentally sustainable use of energy was
taken into account (B ⫽ .11, SE ⫽ .08, p ⫽ .17). Moreover, the
bootstrap results for 5,000 iterations showed that the 95% bias-
corrected CIs excluded zero (.03,
indicating that self-
concordance of sustainable use of energy mediated the effect of the
manipulation on intentions to engage in environmentally sustain-
able energy behaviors.

Study 3

The first two studies showed support for the hypothesis that
self-concordance of a particular environmentally sustainable be-
havior is related to either performance of actions related to that
behavior (shown in Study 1) or intentions to engage in that
behavior (shown in Study 2). In addition, Study 2 found support
for the idea that the connections between behaviors and goals are
malleable, and that self-concordance can be increased by asking
people to think about new connections. Finally, Study 2 demon-
strated that changing self-concordance has a causal effect on
behavioral
test
whether the self-concordance manipulation performs any better
than a traditional climate change manipulation in which people are
encouraged to think about how changing their behavior may help
mitigate against climate change. Therefore, in Study 3, we com-
pared a self-concordance manipulation with both a climate change
manipulation and a control condition. We also used Study 3 to try
and replicate the results of Study 2 in relation to a different
environmentally sustainable behavior, namely commuting to work
via public transport.

Sample

We used another accredited panel organization, Prolific Aca-
demic, to source 300 full-time employed adult participants from
the United Kingdom and United States who opted-in to complete
the study for a small payment of GB£7.50 per hour (we pre-
screened participants to remove any students from the potential
sample). Data from seven out of 301 participants were removed
from the dataset as these participants reported that they worked
from home. Of the remaining 294 responses, 183 reported that they
currently drove to work in a car, motorbike, or similar (the others
walked, cycled, carpooled, or already took public transport). The
majority of respondents chose not to report their gender or highest

level of education, but of the 47% who did, there were roughly
equal numbers of men and women participating (57% men) with a
range of educational levels from high school (16%) or vocational
qualification (13%) through to a Bachelors (56%), Masters (14%)
or PhD (1%) degree.

Method

All participants were shown the following scenario:

Imagine your company has decided to remove the majority of its car
parking spaces to build another building for offices. To ensure you’ll
still be able to get to work, they will heavily subsidize your costs on
public transport.

Participants were then randomly assigned to the self-concordance,
the climate change or the control condition. Similar to Study 2, the
self-concordance condition first identified a range of potential
connections between the target behavior and different goals to give
participants some ideas and then asked them to think about such
connections in a personalized manner. In particular, it said,

The company would like to explain their thinking to you and to
understand what is important to you about commuting and public
transport. Of course, there are disadvantages to catching the bus or
train, but the company believes that commuting to work by public
transport has a number of advantages:
(cid:129) You can save money because you no longer have to pay for as much
insurance or car maintenance (and they will be subsidizing the costs
of the public transport).

(cid:129) You could use that time for leisure activities such as reading or

listening to a book.

(cid:129) You could use that time to catch up (or get ahead) on work if you

wanted to.

(cid:129) It is better for the environment.
(cid:129) You will get more exercise and be healthier as you walk to the bus

stop.

(cid:129) You will be reducing the number of cars on the road so you’ll be

helping others.

(cid:129) Everybody is the same on the bus or train and there are no status

differences so you’ll be reducing perceptual inequality.

Of these, which advantages are most relevant to you personally? And
are there other reasons why commuting via public transport would be
helpful to you? As a reminder, the value that was important to you was

[text piped in here responding to their highest ranked value] and the
goals that were very important to you were [text piped in here
responding to their highest rated goals] so you might want to think
about how commuting via public transport affects those goals. In the
box below, please write down how coming to work by public transport
(e.g., bus, train, tram) will help you to achieve your personal goals and
values.

The climate change condition was very similar but focused
specifically on how commuting via public transport could help
deal with climate change:

The company would like to explain their thinking to you and to
understand what is important to you about commuting and public
transport. Of course, there are disadvantages to catching the bus or
train, but the company believes that commuting to work by public
transport has a number of advantages:
(cid:129) Cars, trucks and SUVs account for approximately 2/3 of the carbon

emissions that come from transportation.

(cid:129) Using public transport will reduce carbon emissions from 32% (if
you use a bus) to 75% (if you use heavy rail such as train or the
underground).

(cid:129) It is better for the environment.
(cid:129) Greater use of public transport means that further housing and
infrastructure development can be more compact, again leading to
fewer carbon emissions.

(cid:129) Public transport providers use energy conservation and technology

to ensure operators have lower emissions.

(cid:129) There will be fewer cars on the road, meaning that there will be
fewer traffic jams - traffic jams are one of the largest causes of high
rates of emissions.

(cid:129) It will help mitigate against climate change.

Of these, which do you think are most relevant to dealing with climate
change? And are there other reasons why commuting via public
transport would help deal with climate change? In the box below,
please write down how coming to work by public transport (e.g., bus,
train, tram) will help reduce climate change.

Finally, the control condition asked for participants’ attitudes

toward commuting by public transport:

your thoughts about coming to work by public transport (e.g., bus,
train, tram).

Responses from 19 people were removed as they did not par-
ticipate in the experimental manipulations (e.g., writing “bus”
instead of considering connections with personal goals and values,
or writing “sdf” instead of considering connections with climate
change mitigation). Of the remaining sample there were 49 people
in the self-concordance condition, 60 in the climate change con-
dition, and 65 in the control condition.

Measures

Commuting intentions. We measured commuting intentions
by asking participants to what extent they agreed or disagreed with
the following four items: “I am likely to take public transport to
work”; “I am likely to take the company up on the offer of
subsidized transport”; “I will find any other option I can take to
avoid taking public transport” (reverse-scored); and “I am likely to
start looking for other jobs and leave this company because of this”
(reverse-scored). Responses were recorded on a 7-point scale from
1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) and internal reliability
was high (␣ ⫽ .84).

Self-concordance. Our measure of self-concordance was
again the same as that for Study 1 except that the target behavior
now related to commuting rather than environmentally sustainable
use of energy. Participants were asked “How helpful do you think
that commuting by public transport is to achieving the following
goals?”, followed by 13 goals. We included “Being successful” to
the other 12 values and goals from the previous studies to more
directly capture a work-related goal that might be relevant to the
more work-related behavior of commuting.

Control variables. We again controlled for environmental
values and this construct was measured in the same way as in
Study 2. In addition, given that commuting by public transport will
have different levels of inconvenience for participants depending
on where they live, and that this is likely to affect their attitudes
toward taking public transport, we asked participants “How incon-
venient would it be for you to travel to work by public transport
(e.g., bus, train, tram)?” and they responded on a scale from 1 (not
at all inconvenient) to 6 (very inconvenient).

Results

Similar to Study 2, we found that the goals that participants in
the self-concordance condition connected to the target behavior
ranged far beyond climate change and environmental goals. In
fact, these goals were only discussed by seven participants in the
self-concordance condition. Again similar to Study 2, the majority
of responses referred to financial goals (24 responses). However
the commuting behavior was also linked to a number of leisure
(having an easy life) goals as well such as relaxing (seven re-
sponses), reading (seven responses), and talking to other people
(three responses).

After controlling for environmental values, there were signifi-
cant differences in the self-concordance of taking public transport
across the three conditions, F(3, 170) ⫽ 3.31, p ⫽ .039; condition
␩2 ⫽ .03; importantly self-concordance of taking public transport

mental values as an extraneous variable, we do not believe this
puts the validity of our results into question.

In sum, the results across the three studies demonstrated support
for our hypotheses. A combination of telling and asking people to
consider how an environmentally sustainable behavior helped
them to achieve their own important goals led to an increase in the
behavior’s self-concordance, which led to a subsequent increase in
intentions to engage in that behavior.

General Discussion

A great deal of research investigating environmentally sustain-
able behaviors, both inside and outside organizations, has looked
at influencing these behaviors by changing people’s environmental
attitudes, beliefs, identities, or values. However, some people are
not susceptible to such an approach, especially those who have
goals or mental models that do not include or are in conflict with
the proposed environmental ones and those who work in organi-
zations which place a low priority on the environment. We there-
fore set out to test an alternative route to influencing environmen-
tally sustainable behaviors. The results of a temporally lagged
study and two experiments suggest that self-concordance of a
sustainable behavior predicts the performance of, or intentions to
perform, that behavior over and above higher-order environmental
goals such as ideology and environmental values. In addition,
results from the two experiments suggest that self-concordance of
a behavior can be influenced by asking people to consider how
the behavior can help them to achieve their personal goals. In the
case of environmentally sustainable behaviors, this works even if
these goals are not related to the environment. This research
therefore contributes to our knowledge of self-concordance, as
well as producing promising results for the practical application
of a new strategy to increase people’s intentions to perform

SELF-CONCORDANCE AND PRO-ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIORS

environmentally sustainable behaviors, regardless of whether or
not they personally hold environmental values and goals.

In the literature to date, self-concordance has already been
related to other behaviors. However, the majority of these behav-
iors had been ones that have clear personal benefits such as
work-related performance (e.g., Bono & Judge, 2003; Molina et
al., 2013) or preparing and planning for high-risk natural hazards
(McNeill et al., 2015). Our research shows that self-concordance is
still a strong motivational factor even for behaviors that are usually
on the periphery of an individual’s self-serving goals, such as
environmentally sustainable behaviors.

In addition, we have added to the literature on self-concordance
by testing both its malleability and the causality of its effects on
behavior. To our knowledge, all previous tests of self-concordance
have used static, correlational analyses. We used experimental
methodology with randomly assigned groups and found that
changing the self-concordance of environmentally sustainable be-
haviors had a greater effect on behavioral intentions than changing
people’s perceptions of how helpful a behavior is in mitigating
climate change. We believe that these results provide strong sup-
port for the use of interventions that influence behavior by chang-
ing the behavior’s self-concordance.

sustainability,

Related to this, our studies provide a theoretical explanation for
previous research which has influenced environmentally sustain-
able behaviors through manipulations, the effectiveness of which
could potentially be explained by an increase in self-concordance
(Bain et al., 2012; Myers et al., 2012). Importantly though, previ-
ous research has often identified specific goals (e.g., public health,
environmental
self-determination theory-related
goals) to connect the target behavior to, which limits the effec-
tiveness of the intervention to those who value those particular
goals (e.g., if people do not hold a public health goal then the
intervention will be ineffective). Our self-concordance manipula-
tion, on the other hand, shows that self-concordance and behavior
can be influenced by letting people weight their own higher-order
goals and by letting them choose which ones they link the sus-
tainable behavior to, instead of dictating to them the goals which
“should” be relevant to them. This allows for a greater effect
across different individuals, because it eliminates the need for
them to place value on any particular, culturally determined goal.
Within the environmental sustainability and corporate social
responsibility literatures we have thus opened up a new theoretical
arena for examining psychosocial determinants. Rather than trying
to change people’s climate change beliefs or goals about the
environment, or trying to convince organizations to make environ-
mentally sustainable behaviors mandatory, our research suggests
that more personally relevant motives can be used. Our research
controlled for environmental goals, using both correlational and
experimental methods, therefore we are relatively confident that
this more individually flexible approach is creating motivation
independently of an individual’s environmental values.

This research can benefit anyone who is trying to increase
environmentally sustainable behaviors, from policymakers to en-
vironmental activists to employers trying to increase sustainable
behavior within their company. Our results suggest that this may
be achieved by developing campaigns that give people examples
of how environmentally sustainable energy use or commuting may
serve a variety of commonly held nonenvironmental goals, and by
letting people consider ways in which the environmentally sus-

tainable behaviors will benefit their own personal goals. For ex-
ample, organizations that are trying to motivate their employees to
adopt more environmentally sustainable behaviors could do so by
letting employees link the target behaviors to common nonenvi-
ronmental workplace goals such as “being a good employee,”
“being a good colleague,” “getting a promotion,” “increasing my
skills,” and so forth.

Importantly, our research shows that promise for the use of such
interventions in organizations that hold mixed motives in relation
to the environment. More specifically, the fictional organization
we used in Study 3 clearly displayed mixed motives by demolish-
ing the parking lot to make way for new office buildings (which
would increase carbon emissions) but providing financial offsets to
employees to take public transport (thereby reducing carbon emis-
sions). We believe that such mixed motives in relation to the
environment are common in organizations as environmental con-
siderations usually have a lower priority than growth or profit.
Using environmental values and goals to motivate employees in
these situations is likely to backfire out of perceived incongruence
with the organization’s actions (cf. Aguinis & Glavas, 2013). We
showed in our studies that the self-concordance approach is effec-
tive in these situations and might, therefore, be especially fruitful
for organizations that are not known to hold strong environmental
values, or that are tied to an industry that seemingly contradicts
them (e.g., oil companies).

Limitations and Directions for Future Research

Of course, our research is not without limitations. First, we
found relatively small to medium effect sizes. We do not believe
that this is a reason to forego research in this area, though. This is
because our studies were somewhat conservative in their ability to
detect this relationship. To begin, the first study had petition
behavior as the behavioral measure of environmentally sustainable
use of energy. This behavior may be seen by some as an activist
behavior as well as an environmentally sustainable energy behav-
ior; thus, our measure of self-concordance, which focused only on
sustainable energy behaviors, might be capturing only part of the
person’s self-concordance of signing the renewable energy peti-
tion, and thus part of
the true relationship between self-
concordance of the behavior and performance of the behavior.
Similarly, in our second study, we aimed to increase the self-
concordance of environmentally sustainable energy behaviors by
encouraging participants to increase the self-concordance of a
wider range of environmentally sustainable behaviors. The finding
that the vast majority of participants focused on environmentally
sustainable energy behaviors was thus beneficial, but somewhat
unexpected. A possible explanation for this is that many partici-
pants might have found it easier to connect environmentally sus-
tainable energy behaviors to a variety of nonenvironmental goals
as compared to other sustainable behaviors. Still, it is possible that
a singular focus on environmentally sustainable energy behaviors
in the intervention would have resulted in an even stronger self-
concordance, and therefore a stronger effect than the broader
approach used in our studies. Our focus on commuting in the third
study was conservative given that many people deeply dislike or
find it inconvenient to use public transport and the fact that we
found even small effects is testament to the usefulness of the
self-concordance approach.

UNSWORTH AND MCNEILL

Second, although manipulating self-concordance should form
an effective alternative to the use of environmental-goal-focused
techniques when targeting climate change deniers and those who
lack environmental goals, our samples were aimed at the general
population and did not specifically focus on these subgroups; thus,
future research would need to test the effectiveness of this strategy
for these groups in particular. However, we did control for envi-
ronmental goals in our analysis, so the effectiveness of the manip-
ulation is apparent even after the variance attributed to people’s
environmental goals is accounted for. In addition, results from the
third study showed that our self-concordance manipulation was
more effective in increasing behavioral intentions than a more
traditional climate change related manipulation in a sample con-
taining many people who hold environmental goals. This suggests
that manipulating self-concordance should be considered as an
alternative to the use of environmental-goal-focused techniques
even when the target audience does hold environmental goals.

Third, the effects in the experimental studies pertain to inten-
tions to perform environmentally sustainable behaviors rather than
the actual performance of sustainable behaviors. Although re-
search has shown a consistent positive relationship between inten-
tions and behaviors even with observed (nonself-reported) behav-
ior and experimental studies (Armitage & Conner, 2001; Webb &
Sheeran, 2006), this relationship is not perfect, and effects on
actual behavior tend to be smaller than on intentions. However, our
first temporally lagged study showed a positive relationship be-
tween self-concordance and a behavioral measure. In addition,
research has identified several strategies that may help close the
gap between intentions and behavior, such as the use of action
plans, referring to a process in which people think about when and
where they will carry out their intended behavior (cf. implemen-
tation intentions; Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006; Sniehotta, Scholz,
& Schwarzer, 2005; Ziegelmann, Luszczynska, Lippke, &
Schwarzer, 2007). Future research could thus test whether manip-
ulating self-concordance leads to actual behavioral outcomes, and
it could focus on combining an increase in self-concordance with
the formation of action plans, in order to more effectively influ-
ence behavior.

Fourth, the demands of the experimental and survey setting
meant that we needed to predetermine a range of values and goals
from which participants could choose and rate their most impor-
tant. Moreover, to capture self-concordance, we needed to ask
participants to rate the helpfulness against all of these goals. Thus,
we were limited in the number of higher-order goals that we could
use before inducing fatigue in the participants. To try and capture
as many people’s possible goals as we could, we used the values
from the widely used Schwartz theory (Schwartz, 1992; S. H.
Schwartz, 1994) as well as the range of goals highlighted in
environmental research (De Young, 2000; Stern & Dietz, 1994).
Nonetheless, it would be good to validate this work with a study
that uses an open-ended approach to identifying goals rather than
the closed questions we used.

Finally, based on the current findings it remains unclear whether
the effect was driven by the formation of new connections between
environmentally sustainable behaviors and personal goals, or
whether it can be explained by bringing existing connections
between the behavior and personal goals into conscious awareness,
or a combination of the two. As a result, it is unclear whether the
effects would hold over time, without repeatedly asking people to

form these connections. However, research from other domains
has shown that building connections between a behavioral goal
and higher-order goal will have lasting effects on the motivation to
perform the behavior, even after the connection between the be-
havior and higher-order goal no longer exist in reality (Carr &
Walton, 2014). This thus shows promise for the idea that the
effects of the tested strategy on intentions to perform environmen-
tally sustainable behaviors could hold over time, without the need
for repeated reminders.

Conclusions

This research has provided important initial support for a new
way to increase sustainable energy behaviors and commuting
behaviors that eliminates the need for people to hold pro-
environmental goals or attitudes. It suggests that motivation to
perform environmentally sustainable behaviors can be increased
by letting people connect these behaviors to higher-order goals of
their own personal choice.

In sum, we have identified a nonenvironmental pathway through
which we can increase environmentally sustainable behaviors. We
are definitely not suggesting that we should give up on environ-
mental values altogether. However we do believe that our self-
concordance based approach can provide an effective alternative to
increase environmentally sustainable behaviors and might be an
especially useful approach to increase such behaviors among those
who otherwise would not consider it at all. Addressing and adapt-
ing to climate change requires that everyone engage in sustainable
behaviors in both the home and the workplace. We have shown
that linking these behaviors to a person’s goals, regardless of
whether or not they are environmental goals, will go some way to
meeting this challenge.
