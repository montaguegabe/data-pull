b'Climate change advocates rejoiced this year when 21 young Americans sued the federal government, including President Donald Trump. They alleged that federal agencies havent done enough to curb global warming and that their actions have made it worse. Several fossil fuel industry groups actually pulled out of the suit because they couldnt convincingly argue that climate change isnt real.\nNow another band of pint sized activists is prepping a climate change suit-and this one could have international implications.\nA group of Portuguese children is crowdfunding a lawsuit to sue 47 European nations, alleging that these countries have failed to tackle climate change and so threaten their right to life. The young people (ages five to 14) hail from Leiria, a region devastated by large forest fires that killed at least 60 people this summer.\nLawyers from the Global Legal Action Network (GLAN), a nonprofit fighting international human rights violations, are representing the children in their case, which would be heard in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France.\nThe legal action will target 47 major emitters in Europe, including the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany and France. These countries are responsible for about 15 percent of global emissions. GLANs attorneys want the nations in the suit to strengthen their emissions reduction policies and commit to keeping the majority of their existing fossil fuel reserves in the ground.\nClimate change poses a major and increasingly worsening threat to a number of human rights, and governments in Europe are simply not doing enough to address it, lead counsel Marc Willers told The Guardian.\nResearchers have linked the Leiria forest fires to climate change, pointing out that a heat wave in Portugal extended the wildfire season from two months (July and August) to five months (June to October).\nGLAN is fundraising for the suit on CrowdJustice, a platform used specifically to fund legal action. In their pitch, the lawyers focus on the increasing amount of devastating weather events linked to climate change, including not only the Leiria fires but also Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.\nThe lawyers are asking for 20,000 pounds (roughly $27,000) by October 25 and have raised about 25 percent of their goal. Because CrowdJustices terms of use include an all or nothing policy, GLAN wont receive any of the funds raised unless the campaign reaches its goal. The organization estimated that the case will cost about 350,000 pounds ($472,000) in total.\nIts not just David versus Goliath, the pitch reads. Its David versus many Goliaths.\nOne silver lining for the Portuguese legal team is that similar cases have already held up in court. While a verdict hasnt yet been reached in the American case, a Dutch court ruled in favor of 800 Netherlands residents who sued their government in 2015. The country must now cut its greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent by 2020.\nPortuguese Kids Crowdfund Climate Change Suit Against 47 European Countries\nCredit: John Bonazzo\n'b'\nDonald Trump\'s opinions on climate change have been clear since he tweeted that it\'s a hoax created by the Chinese. Today, he acted on his position (which is in opposition to 97 percent of the scientific community) when he announced that the U.S. will exit the Paris Climate agreement. \n\n"In order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord," he said. \n\nThis move goes against the will of the American people--71 percent support U.S. involvement. Additionally, more than 800 colleges and universities, 1,000 American companies and even fossil fuel giants like ExxonMobil, Shell and BP support the agreement, which has been joined by all countries except Syria and Nicaragua. And now America. Even Elon Musk just announced he is quitting Trump\'s advisory council in the wake of this decision. \n\nWhile the reaction to everything Trump does and says is swift and ruthless, it was especially pungent here. To many, this is a move unlike the rest--because nothing else will matter at all if we destroy the planet. \n\nHere\'s how people were reacting to the decision. The shade and snark was truly next-level. \n\nCredit: Sage Lazzaro \n'b'Montana farmers and ranchers know the climate is changing.\nAs evidence, Montana State University Adjunct Professor Timothy Seipel presented a survey Monday that showed 83.5 percent of farmers questioned see climate change as a problem.\nDespite that acknowledgement, about 43 percent of 424 farmers and ranchers around Montana surveyed by members of Climate Research Assessment in Montana and the Northern Great Plains did not believe climate change was caused by humans, Seipel said. The 36 percent who did believe human activities spurred on climate change were all likely to be more liberal. The more conservative a person in the survey was, the more likely they were to believe climate change wasn\'t happening, despite what has been perceived by farmers across the state, Seipel said.\nSeipel summed up the deeper point of the entire forum, hosted at the University Center Theater by the University of Montana Climate Change Studies Program and the Montana National Wildlife Federation.\n"We need to depoliticize the causes of climate change," Seipel said.\nThe forum was planned months before last week\'s announcement from President Donald Trump that the United States would be pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement. While the scientists at the forum tried to keep their presentations focused on the evidence of climate change and the potential effects that increased temperatures and carbon emissions could have on the state, the president\'s decision was brought up early by Nobel Laureate Steve Running.\nIn the hour before Running gave his presentation at the conference, he came across an open letter to parties to the Paris Agreement from U.S. state, local, and business leaders.\n"I\'ve never seen anything like this in my lifetime," said Running, the UM Regents Professor of Ecology.\nRunning shared a Nobel Peace Prize with members of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a body that produces objective, scientific reports on climate change and its political and economic impacts.\nIf changes aren\'t made, Montana\'s temperatures are expected to rise 12 degrees over the next 30 years, which could turn Montana into a ghost town, Running said.\nWhat could make a significant difference in carbon emissions all over the world is if people would stop burning coal, Running said. Already China is canceling large coal plant projects and India is as well, investing instead in solar panels, Running said.\n"Coal is a public health menace," Running said.\nBut towns in Montana are tied to the doomed coal industry, Running said. One of his first research projects in the 1980s was on the town of Colstrip. With a wider economy, maybe it would be easier to shift the industry, but there are still jobs in cleaning up the coal plants and other industries.\n"Most of the people there probably have marketable skills, they do have potential," Running said.\nBut Running said he isn\'t interested in convincing people of that. The people Running is trying to reach are the one-third of the voting public who shrug at the idea of global warming and don\'t see it as a global emergency, Running said.\nSo education and a more scientifically literate public are goals for people like Alisa Wade, a UM geosciences conservation scientist and spatial ecologist. Wade has taught the university\'s Introduction to Climate Change class it and students told her it was good to understand the science behind their beliefs - and have better arguments for their parents, she said.\n"I really did like the idea of being focused on the science behind climate change," Wade said.\nClimate change is such a complex theory, which opens it up for people to be misinformed about what is going on, Wade said. Scientists try to explain what is happening, with all the caveats they are trained to include, Wade said. Then people take that information and find its flaws.\n"People want to pick it apart," Wade said. "But they don\'t want to come back to us after they\'ve picked apart, and talk to us and dig deeper into the issues."\nYes, the earth has temperature cycles, but scientists for the most part understand those temperature cycles and can point to the causes, Wade said.\nBased on the best scientific data available, carbon emissions are reason there are projected to be more days over 90 degrees in Montana and fewer with freezing temperatures over the next 30 years, Wade said.\nThe effects will be seen in longer fire seasons, which will cause more carbon emissions, Wade said.\nAnother effect - a reduction in the population of Montana\'s snowshoe hares, said Steve Mills, UM associate vice president of research for global change and sustainability. The hares need to change their coats from white to brown when the snowpack melts, but because the melts are happening much earlier than in the past, many of the hares are still white when they should already have changed colors.\nAnd, the effect can be seen on the farm of Matt Bell\'s grandfather. Bell was one of about 100 people who attended the forum and who lined up to ask more questions after it was done. Bell\'s grandfather has a farm on the Fort Belknap Reservation and has had difficulty in past seasons fighting the increasing number of weeds cropping up.\n"At some of the higher temperatures the models are projecting, society as it works now will not be feasible," Wade said. "If the models are correct, and we continue on the business as usual path, we\'re to see the highest of the hots neat the end of this century. If that happens, the world will look undeniably different."\n'b'The government\'s top public health agency has canceled a February conference on climate change and health but isn\'t saying why publicly.\nBut a co-sponsor was told by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that the agency was worried how the conference would be viewed by the Trump administration.\nIn an email response to a request from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, a CDC spokeswoman wrote that three days before Christmas, the agency began telling registered participants the February 2017 summit would be postponed. :\n"We are exploring options to reschedule the meeting while considering budget priorities for fiscal year 2017," the Atlanta-based agency wrote in an official statement. It would also look for "potential overlap with an APHA (American Public Health Association) conference on the same topic also being held later in 2017."\nThe incoming administration did not ask or order that the meeting be canceled, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.\n"They had no idea or not whether the new administration would be supportive," said Benjamin, whose group was a co-sponsor of the event with the CDC.\nRather, the decision was "a strategic retreat," intended to head off a possible last-minute cancellation or other repercussions from Trump officials who may prove hostile to spending money on climate change science, Benjamin said Monday.\n"They decided the better part of valor was to stop and regroup" until it could be discussed with Trump\'s new health leadership, Benjamin said. A new CDC director has not been named.\nBenjamin called the decision understandable but worrisome. He was echoed by Kristie Ebi, a professor of global health at the University of Washington in Seattle, who was invited to speak at the conference.\n"In the long run, climate change is affecting the health of Americans," she said. "At some point, I hope they will go forward with the conference."\nIan Karra, an organizer for the Sierra Club, said the move to cancel the summit was "deeply disturbing."\n"The Trump administration has a responsibility to take climate change seriously," Karra said. "If the CDC is taking this step preemptively, we hope it will show some climate courage going forward."\nPublic health experts say climate change is a man-made problem that contributes to a range of health issues and illnesses, including heat stroke and diseases spread by tropical insects. The CDC has a $10 million program on climate and health, and published guidelines to help local health officials deal with human vulnerability to climate change.\nIn 2012, Trump tweeted that the concept of global warming was created by the Chinese to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. He later said he was joking, but during the presidential campaign referred to global warming as "a hoax."\nBefore he took office, Trump met with former Vice President Al Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio, both prominent climate activists. Trump picked Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as head of the Environmental Protection Agency. During his confirmation hearing, Pruitt backed away from his own past statements and said climate change is real.\nCredit: Staff and wire reports; AJC staff writer Rosalind Bentley contributed to this article., Staff\n'b'Dane County\'s first ever Office of Energy and Climate Change is up and running with Keith Reopelle at the helm as director.\nReopelle comes to the position with 32 years of experience at Clean Wisconsin, where he was most recently the senior policy director. While there, he led clean energy campaigns at the state and regional levels.\n"My whole career has been in environmental protection, but climate change specifically, I think, is the biggest environmental challenge of this century," Reopelle said.\nDane County Executive Joe Parisi created the office and corresponding Council on Climate Change, comprised of many private and public partners, in his 2017 budget to implement climate change strategies.\nReopelle is leading the creation of a Climate Action Plan, which will look like a series of policies, programs and projects. After the report is adopted, Reopelle will oversee the implementation of the plan.\n"Our goal is to make Dane County a national and world leader in not only reducing carbon pollution but also reducing carbon pollution in a way that has direct economic and health benefits to all citizens of Dane County," Reopelle said.\nReopelle is also tasked with looking at the greenhouse gas condition profile of other other Dane County departments to help the county find ways to reduce its own carbon emissions. The county has already taken steps to reduce the effects of climate change, including fueling its fleet with compressed natural gas and investing in solar energy.\nDane County\'s efforts to lead the way on climate change efforts is part of what attracted Reopelle to the job, he said.\n"Under County Executive Parisi, Dane County has made tremendous strides in investing in clean renewable technology," Reopelle said. "I knew with that kind of leadership, this would be a great place for me." \nWhat makes you passionate about this work? \nThe biggest reason, I think, is the fact that I have two daughters: one just done with college and one is finishing up. Really, climate change is so much more important now - the rain storms this spring are a dramatic example of that - but obviously, our children and their children are going to be hit much harder by climate change.\nIt\'s really imperative we take big steps now to head off climate change because if we don\'t, we\'re going to be leaving our children and future generations a world that is not nearly as healthy and safe as the one that we live in now. That\'s the thing that really should motivate all of us to do something about climate change.\nIt just seems imperative, and it seems crazy to put short-term economic interests of industries like the fossil fuel industry ahead of our children\'s future. \nWhat are some effects of climate change Dane County is seeing? \nThere\'s a lot of them but certainly flooding and the economic cost that go with flooding in terms of everything from having to get water out of your basement, like so many people on the west side of Madison have had to do this spring. The fact that we have had multiple 4- and 5-inch rain events over the course of a couple of months is really unheard of historically, but we should get used to it because that\'s going to happen more and more often. That is absolutely a result of climate change - basically the warmer the climate the the more moisture the atmosphere holds and the bigger rain events.\nThere\'s a big adverse health impact in terms of the air quality as a result of climate change. Warmer summer days result in more ozone formation and ozone smog.\nDroughts will become more common as well. We\'ll get more heavy rain events. We\'ll get more frequent storms with more rain in each of those storms, but we\'ll also experience longer periods of time without rain particularly in the summer months Deterioration in lakes: We\'ve seen more blue green algae blooms. The rainfall events basically lead to nutrient loading into the lakes and rivers in Dane County and that results in higher algae blooms and more weed growth, and it makes it unhealthy to swim in our lakes and so unpleasant to swim in our lakes.\nWe\'re going to see more rain in the winter, more freezing rain and more icy conditions. \nWill the Climate Action Plan make a difference or are we past the point of no return? \nIf we don\'t aggressively start taking steps to get there, we will not only have to take those steps later but probably also spend many trillions of dollars to mechanically pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.\nYes, Dane County has done a lot already. In a relative sense to what needs to be done, it is a tiny bit. That\'s why this climate action plan we\'re coming up with - needs to put us on a path to deep carbon pollution reductions. We simply have to get on that path. The sooner we get on that path, the sooner the other 71 counties in Wisconsin are likely to follow. \nHas the politicized outlook on climate change affected your mindset in addressing it\'\nIt\'s very unfortunate that climate change and the science of climate change has become politicized to the extent that it has. In the long run, I\'m very confident that it\'s not going to make much difference, and the reason I say that is that Dane County has been a leader and will be much more of a leader a year from now, five years from now.\nThe other reason I say I\'m very confident the politics in the end aren\'t going to make a difference is industry itself and citizens themselves are going to take action. The world understands that climate change is real. This is happening. The markets understand that climate change is real and is happening. Industries understand.\nRead the extended interview at captimes.com\nCredit: By Abigail Becker\n'b'Publication: The Wesleyan Argus, Wesleyan University, Middletown CT.\nLast Wednesday night, the Climate Ambassadors hosted a faculty panel discussing funding for the sciences and the importanceof climate change issues in the current administration. Over forty students attended, and the two panelists were University professors: Joyce Powzyk, Assistant Professor of Practice in Biology, and Suzanne OConnell, Professor of Earth and Environmental Sciences.\nBoth professors started off the panel discussion with introducing themselves. OConnell talked about her work with paleoclimate science in Antarctica, while Powzyk talked about her experiences in Madagascar and her work with lemurs. Powzyk also expanded on how climate change is affecting the Malagasy communities, and how she wanted to disseminate information about climate change and its possible negative effect on the lemurs through comic books.\nThe panel mainly consisted of an open Q&A session, during which any audience member could ask questions to the panelists. Both OConnell and Powzyk emphasized the importance of the government focusing on climate change.\nOConnell also stated how climate change is an important security issue for the country, and that the government needs to shift focus toward this long-term issue. She also mentioned that there is a possibility of a two-feet sea level growth by the end of the century, which may affect U.S. national security as there are many naval bases in lower elevation areas.\nI think its short sighted for the government to increase security using the militarybut climate change issues [are] irreparable, OConnell said.\nIn addition to security, climate change also has the potential to affect the economy in negative ways.\nA student brought up a questionabout the newly launched 314 Action, a nonprofit that was founded by members of the STEM community, its supporters, and political activists. Among their other goals is increasing political activism amongst scientists. OConnell talked about how the role of the scientist had evolved and it was now time for them to get more involved.\nForty years ago, [scientists] would never think about going to congress or going to a march, OConnell said. But now theyre all aware that we as scientists need to be out there to inform the public about things.\nScientists now also receive skills builders for educating the public, including tips on how to write op-eds and do interviews.\nPowzyk talked about her husbands experience with being a scientist interested in getting involved politically, but could not run for office full-time because of restrictions he received from the University administration. As he wouldve lost possible grants and would not be able to work full-time if he ran for office, he decided instead to volunteerfor a planning and zoning commission in Middletown.\nBoth panelists also gave advice on how to deal with climate change deniers. They also agreed that the term climate change has become so polarized that the term should be renamed. OConnell discussed how the term used to be more widely thought of as global warming, but then people stated that they would like it warmer.\nOConnell also brought up an interview that Bill Nye did on Fox News about climate change, and in using that as an example, told the audience that they needed to bring in solid facts from scientists to these climate change deniers.\nAnother student in the audience then questioned how broadcast media has been portraying scientists, especially climate scientists, through a split screen.\nScientists are equated with any Joe Schmoe who works at a climate change denial special interest political think tank, because they get fifty percent of the screen, the student said. Its interesting how the concept of science has become politicized as a liberal/democrat oriented issue. Is there a way to bridge that divide and depoliticize climate change?\nPowzyk responded by focusing on education and the role that schools can play in increasing climate change awareness. Through focusing on the science, it can become less of a polarized issue. Powzyk also talked about a certain politician, wishing that he had gotten more education about climate science before choosing a political affiliation.\nOConnell talked about a personal experience when she was attending a Congressional Day for scientists several years ago. She witnessed a politicianupon seeing that his water glass wasnt flowing over when the ice meltedsaying that climate change wasnt real.\nI dont know if its deliberate ignorance, but it was one appalling statement after another, OConnell said.\nAs the talk took a more negative turn about the future, a student asked how to become heartened again.\nI write op-eds, I teach people like you, OConnell said, on how she keeps hope and works for environmental advocacy. We can make this whole situation work when we put our minds to it. I dont feel hopeless about it.\nPowzyk said that working in Madagascar with Malagasy kids has kept her heartened.\nThe talk ended with both panelists encouraging students that small actions for the environment on campus can really help. OConnell also mentioned the impact that calling a politician can make. Powzyk also spoke on how she was disappointed at the lack of communication between people with different political affiliations.\nI need to invite more Republicans to dinner; I dont like the fact that were not talking, Powyzk said. So you should all invite a Republican to dinner.\nCredit: Natasha Nurjadin, Features Editor\n'b'My name is Stacy Hunt. I own a small business here in Missoula, focused on energy efficiency and renewable energy, and Ive worked with federal agencies for 17 years. I am intensely aware of the impacts of climate change - and the importance of our federal energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.\nWe are greatly concerned with our nations dismissal of climate change impacts.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - IPCC - has made it abundantly clear that warming will continue through to the next century. IPCC and dozens of other respected international (and national) agencies prove this science. It is simple fact.\nAnother simple fact: our western states will be impacted more quickly and severely than our eastern sisters, and these impacts are very real for Montana.\nTemperature and precipitation changes will wreak havoc on Montana and we must address these issues in our national policy on climate change mitigation and adaptation.\nIn Montana, we are in a unique position. Our economy is both a necessary contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and on the front lines of those most economically challenged by the impact of climate change. These two things have historically been adversarial. But its our responsibility to find a path that secures stability and growth for all Montanans, while protecting valuable resources.\nThe risk to Montana due to climate change impacts are as follows. This is not exhaustive.\n***\n\nAgriculture:\n\nThe Montana Farmers Union - celebrating their 100th anniversary this year - issued a report that concludes that climate change will cost the Montana agriculture industry $736 million a year and almost 25,000 jobs by 2055. This impact is a result of significant decreases in rangeland cattle and grain production, increases in threatening weeds and pests, increased temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations, and water shortages.\n***\n\nTourism, outdoor recreation and hunting:\n\nMore than 10 million people visit Montana each year, spending $5.8 billion, supporting 64,000 jobs and generating $403 million in tax revenue. This includes visits to national parks, fishing, hunting, snow and water sports. Climate change is already:\n* Reducing snow sport tourism; our 17 ski resorts employ more than 1,100 people and have seen radical decreases in snow cover and visitors since 2006.\n* Warming our waters, increasing stress and decreasing fish stocks and increasing waterway closures.\n* Creating habitat and disease-related risks for land wildlife populations, which will sacrifice not only hunting tourism, but a huge source of our residents food and an strong tradition of hunting that is inherently and uniquely Montana.\n***\n\nForest fires:\n\nClimate change has doubled the area affected by forest fires in the U.S. West in the last 30 years and is increasing the length of forest fire season in Montana. This has severe consequences to our timber industry, access to public lands, hunting, fishing, outdoor recreation, and the health of Montanans, especially our very young and very old.\nOur nations policy and action on climate change must not falter and our legislators hold huge responsibility to work across federal agencies and party lines.\nWe must insist that our government creates and implements sound energy and climate change policy to both mitigate and adapt to climate change.\nI do not profess to hold all of the solutions to this incredible problem. There are many people out there who are brighter, more informed and more qualified to assist our nation - and Montana - in tackling this significant problem.\nBut, at the very least, we must ask our legislators to:\n* Ensure that climate change science is recognized as the fact that it is.\n* Ensure that our newly appointed cabinet members do not gut climate change by pulling out of the Paris climate change talks. We must be part of this global community.\n* Ensure that our new administration does not gut our federal programs that reduce carbon emissions in our country - and Montana - such as the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy at the U.S. Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n* Ensure that moving forward, our energy policy and portfolio is balanced and includes an aggressive renewable energy portfolio.\nWe must not be silent. Our welfare depends on us.\n'b'Professor Steve Running, whose work on climate science shared in a Nobel Peace Prize in 2007, accepted a buyout offer and retired in July from the University of Montana.\n"I\'m 67 years old," Running said Thursday. "I\'m getting older and kind of tired-er and beat down by the climate wars.\n"So this is really a chance to both help the university budget crisis and preserve my own personal energy for more climate wars, which I wish weren\'t necessary. But it appears that they are."\nPresident Donald Trump has called climate change a "hoax," although he more recently said there\'s "some connectivity" between human activity and global warming.\nJust last week, though, the administration formally told the United Nations that the U.S. plans to pull out of the 2015 Paris climate pact to cut emissions that contribute to rising temperatures, making official the president\'s announcement in June.\nThis week, the New York Times broadcast the findings of a "sweeping federal climate change report" by scientists from 13 agencies. The newspaper said the draft report contradicts the Trump administration\'s claims that human contribution to climate change is uncertain.\nMany lines of evidence demonstrate that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse (heat-trapping) gases, are primarily responsible for recent observed climate change, wrote the scientists as quoted in the Times.\nScientists are waiting to see how the Trump administration will react to the report. Running said the recent election has fueled the climate wars, and he needs to put energy into that cause.\nAt UM 37 years, he launched the climate change minor there. Although enrollment has gone down at UM in recent years, enrollment in an introductory climate class had gone up 50 percent since the minor started in 2009.\nUM counted itself as the first university in the nation to start an academic program in climate change, and an external reviewer described the program last year as belonging firmly to the unfolding future rather than the past.\nWhile there are now a few other climate change minors in the U.S., yours remains a standout, wrote SueEllen Campbell, a professor in the department of English at Colorado State University. The closest match is at Cornell University, a somewhat larger and much richer school.\n***\n\nRunning said he feels more mentally tired than he did 10 years ago, and he plans to put his remaining energy into making progress on climate policy.\nIn 2007, the Nobel Committee awarded the Peace Prize to two recipients, Al Gore and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Running was one of the IPCC authors lauded for their "efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change."\nAlthough Running retired from teaching in the classroom, he plans to continue to serve on national committees and has five or six speaking engagements on the docket. He\'s an expert witness on a couple of climate lawsuits and he\'s scheduled to speak at conferences in Spain, Chile and Maine this fall.\n"Actually, this gives me more flexibility and more time for public speaking," Running said.\nThe last few years at UM have been fraught with enrollment drops and budget cuts, and Running also said he believes it\'s time for the school to make some organizational changes.\n"I think the university needs to do some serious restructuring, and I don\'t want to be a part of that battle," Running said.\n***\n\nIn an email, President Sheila Stearns said she hopes Running will stay involved with the campus in the future.\n"Professor Running has been an internationally acclaimed scientist for decades at the University of Montana," Stearns said. "We are as proud as ever of his participation in the Nobel Laureate IPCC.\n"The Board of Regents years ago named him one of our few Regents Professors for his stellar scholarship. Im sure I speak for his colleagues when I say we hope he wont be a stranger to UM after he retires."\nNicky Phear, director of the Climate Change Studies program, said Running energized students in his classes.\n"Steve Running was an inspiring professor for many students," Phear said in an email. "He taught big picture concepts to students to help them understand basic global climate principles, and he didn\'t hold back sharing the risks and challenges ahead.\n"He always wove in discussion about solutions, and he left our undergrads feeling like there was possibility for change, and that they could be leaders in that change."\nShe also said enrollment is up in the minor program and primed for growth with dedicated faculty and administrative support.\nClimate Change Studies "is just one of a great many programs at UM focused on the environment and sustainability, and they are all strong enough to endure beyond particular individuals," Phear said. "That said, his are huge shoes to fill, and I will personally miss teaching with him."\nShe believes he\'ll have a role in the future in an advisory capacity and continue to inspire those in his field. Running said an IRS rule means he needs to stay away from campus for five months, but he anticipates visiting to lecture down the road.\n"Probably in a year, I\'ll give guest lectures periodically as invited. But not this fall," Running said.\n'b'WASHINGTON * President Donald Trump\'s decision to pull out of the landmark Paris climate accord sends an unmistakable message to the world: America First can mean America Alone.\nTrump\'s move, announced with great fanfare in the White House Rose Garden on Thursday, immediately leaves the United States isolated on a paramount global concern. It demonstrates the U.S. is willing to back away from a coalition it assembled just 18 months ago. Nearly 200 countries joined the landmark deal forged under Trump\'s predecessor. Now the U.S. stands with only Syria and Nicaragua as countries on the sidelines. Nicaragua balked because it found the deal\'s standards not strict enough.\nIt\'s a bitter blow to stalwart European partners who launched an aggressive campaign to convince Trump that American leadership is central to combatting climate change. Even a direct appeal from the Vatican wasn\'t enough to persuade the president.\nMiguel Arias Canete, the European Union\'s top climate change official, called Trump\'s decision "a sad day for the global community."\nFor anxious allies, Trump\'s rejection of the Paris pact is particularly jarring in the wake of his first international trip last week. Standing in the heart of Europe, Trump publicly lectured NATO partners about their military commitments and offered no explicit endorsement for the collective defense agreement at the core of trans-Atlantic security for decades. His stunning posture left the distinct impression that for the new American president, the nation\'s long-standing obligations to allies are neither unshakable nor unbreakable.\nTrump did little to quell those concerns Thursday. Offering a glimpse into his apparent anxiety over how he\'s viewed on the world stage, Trump argued that the same countries practically begging him to stay in the Paris accord were in fact mocking the United States\' participation.\n"We don\'t want other countries laughing at us anymore and they won\'t," Trump declared. "I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris."\nIndeed, Trump\'s supporters cheered the decision, which marked the fulfillment both of his campaign promise to scrap the climate accord and his broader pledge to put American interests above all else. As a candidate, he vigorously accused President Barack Obama of capitulating to other nations in negotiations not only on the Paris pact, but also multicountry trade deals and the agreement to curb Iran\'s nuclear ambitions.\nTrump\'s record of holding to those promises is mixed: He moved swiftly to withdraw from the sweeping Pacific Rim trade pact the Obama administration negotiated, but has signaled to other nations that he plans to stay in the nuclear deal so long as Iran lives up to its obligations.\nTo be sure, Trump is hardly the first American president to turn his back on a predecessor\'s international agreement. President George W. Bush provoked similar anger from European allies when he decided not to implement the 1997 Kyoto climate change treaty, which was ratified by 140 nations. Bush made a similar argument to the one outlined by Trump Thursday, saying it put the U.S. at a disadvantage compared with major polluters such as China and India.\nStill, Bush made the broad and public case for U.S. leadership in international cooperation, even as his policies in Iraq and Afghanistan frayed some American alliances.\nTrump\'s "America First" mantra, underscored by his condemnation of both Bush\'s wars and Obama\'s diplomacy, has signaled a new strain of isolationism. On Thursday, he not only called the Paris accord a bad deal, he declared its rejection to be "a reassertion of America\'s sovereignty."\nSince the election, administration officials have labored to explain that Trump does not intend to insulate the U.S. from the rest of the world or leave allies in a lurch. White House advisers point to Trump\'s decision to renegotiate, rather than scrap, the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico as a sign that the president isn\'t recoiling from all of America\'s commitments.\nTrump left open the prospect that he\'ll ultimately take a similar approach to the Paris pact, announcing Thursday that while the U.S. will immediately stop complying with the standards, his administration will begin negotiations to seek a better deal. It\'s unclear why the U.S. would need to start such negotiations given that the climate agreement gave each country the ability to set its own targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe European nations that pushed for Trump to stay in the deal appear to be in little mood to help the president take credit for a getting a better deal. France, Germany and Italy quickly issued a joint statement Thursday saying the Paris climate accord can\'t be renegotiated.\nJapan said Friday that the decision was "regrettable."\nAnd supporters of the agreement in the U.S., which was painstakingly negotiated under the Obama administration, argued that even if that were possible, the damage to America\'s reputation had already been done.\n"The rest of the world will question whether the United States can be trusted," said Gina McCarthy, who served as Environmental Protection Agency administrator under Obama.\nTrump announced the withdrawal the same day he pulled back from another campaign promise: to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. While Trump ultimately sided with Arab leaders who\'d implored him not to move the embassy, on the climate deal he seemed indifferent to similarly aggressive lobbying from America\'s closest partners in Europe.\n"If you\'re sitting in Riyadh or Amman or Cairo, the president of the United States has just bowed to your concerns to a much greater degree than he has bowed to the concerns of Paris, Berlin and other traditional allies on an issue of global impact," said Robert Satloff, who runs the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\nTesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Robert Iger said Thursday that they would leave White House advisory councils after Trump\'s announcement.\n"Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said in a Twitter post. He is a member of the President\'s Strategic and Policy Forum, a business advisory group, and Trump\'s manufacturing jobs council.\nCredit: JULIE PACE; Associated Press\nCaption: President Donald Trump listens to a speaker in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, March 21, 2017, during a signing ceremony for a bill to increase NASA\'s budget to $19.5 billion and directs the agency to focus human exploration of deep space and Mars. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n'b'The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officially confirmed last week that 2016 was the Earth\'s hottest year on record, surpassing 2015, which surpassed 2014. The NOAA had reported this unofficially back in January. What made last week\'s announcement noteworthy is that the NOAA is now part of the administration of President Donald Trump, who has famously called global warming a "hoax."\nClimate change denial is getting a little tricky for the president and his fellow Republicans. Politico reported last week that some business groups, including those allied with Charles and David Koch\'s powerful interests, are pushing back against the aggressive efforts of Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt to deny human-induced climate change.\nThese groups would rather not argue against the scientific consensus that man-made global warming is a growing threat. They want to roll back environmental regulations anyway without getting into debates that might hurt moderate Republicans. It\'s an amazingly cynical strategy: Don\'t argue the evidence or address the problem. Just ignore it.\nThe Trump administration has another chance this week to consider the choice between deny and ignore. Friday is the deadline for the heads of the 13 federal agencies that study various aspects of climate change to sign off on a draft of the Climate Science Special Report compiled by the scientists who work for their agencies. The report is part of the quadrennial National Climate Assessment mandated by Congress in 1990.\nThe draft was posted on the private nonprofit Internet Archive in January at a time when scientists feared that Trump might halt all climate research. It came to light last week when The New York Times reported that some government scientists were still concerned about potential Trump administration censorship.\nThe 673-page report largely reflects findings of hundreds, if not thousands, of previous studies of climate change, including those of the U.N.\'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This is not surprising: Good science must be replicable.\nThis report concludes that "it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. For the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence."\nScientists don\'t throw terms like "extremely likely" around casually. It means a 95 percent to 100 percent probability. And yet Pruitt, Trump\'s chief environmental official, scoffs at the concept that carbon dioxide released by human activity is a primary cause of global warming.\nThe draft report ventures into the quickly evolving field of "attribution science," suggesting that there\'s a "very high level of confidence" that global warming is responsible for extreme temperatures and "high confidence" that it\'s responsible for extreme precipitation.\nThe scientific argument is over. It\'s silly to deny it. It\'s shameful to know it and ignore it.\nCredit: By the Editorial Board\nCaption: The midnight sun shines across sea ice along the Northwest Passage in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago on July 23.

Scott Walker\'s proposal to do away with the subscriber- supported Wisconsin Natural Resources magazine fits a pattern that included suppressing articles on climate science and endangered species that started after Republicans took over state government, the magazine\'s former editor said Monday.\nMeanwhile, two former Department of Natural Resources secretaries said eliminating the magazine would undermine volunteer conservation groups and public understanding of DNR programs in ways that will harm the environment over time.\nThe bimonthly magazine would be shuttered as part of Walker\'s 2017-19 state budget plan. One reason the proposal is drawing criticism is that it wouldn\'t save any tax dollars.\nThe nearly 100-year-old publication is supported entirely by its 88,000 subscribers.\nSpokesmen for Walker and for the DNR on Monday defended the proposal by saying the DNR must become more efficient and narrowly focused, and government shouldn\'t be in the publishing business.\nThey denied that closing down the magazine was evidence of an anti-science agenda despite previous budget cuts targeting DNR scientists and educators, a climate- related gag order at a state agency, and the removal of climate science pages from the websites of the DNR and the state Public Service Commission.\nThe magazine covers hunting, fishing and the science behind the DNR\'s work and the efforts of volunteer conservation groups. When the state began publishing it in 1919, it was called The Wisconsin Conservationist.\nAfter Walker took office in 2011, his appointees and other top managers at the DNR insisted on seeing every article before publication, said Natasha Kassulke, who left the DNR last summer after 15 years, including five editing the magazine.\nThe scrutiny grew tighter after the magazine carried a special section on climate change produced by the UW-Madison Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies, Kassulke said.\nDNR managers spiked an article on how climate change affects Wisconsin mammals, as well as a piece on an endangered species whose primary habitat was around the proposed site for a controversial iron mine that was being promoted by Walker and GOP lawmakers, she said.\n"I sort of got the message to stop even trying," said Kassulke, a former Wisconsin State Journal reporter who now works for UW-Madison.\nKassulke said employees in the DNR communications office were told not to use terms like "climate change" and "global warming" when writing for publication. However, the term "our changing climate" was deemed acceptable, she said.\n*Not part of core mission\'\nWalker\'s spokesman denied cutting the magazine was part of an anti-science, anti-environment agenda.\n"That\'s a ridiculous claim," spokesman Tom Evenson said in a statement. "The DNR is realigning to become more efficient and effective. This magazine is not a part of the DNR\'s core mission. It is not the government\'s role to produce magazines that duplicate what is available in the private market."\nDNR spokesman Jim Dick denied that DNR managers have suppressed certain topics in the DNR magazine. He listed 12 recent articles that "deal with some sort of science, environment or environmental education topics." The articles covered geology, invasive species, a summer program for tribal youth, birds, volunteers who monitor water quality, and more. Under a recent reorganization aimed at coping with about two decades of budget cuts, DNR employees no longer have time to write for the magazine, Dick said. But former DNR secretary George Meyer scoffed at the notion that the DNR\'s 2,500 employees don\'t have time to write occasional articles about their research and their work.\n"Some of these (DNR) programs probably write one article a year," said Meyer, who now directs the Wisconsin Wildlife Federation, adding that many of the articles are contributed by writers outside the department.\n"I really strongly disagree that public education isn\'t part of their core functions," Meyer added.\nThe magazine plays a big role in recruiting volunteers who help DNR scientists count wild-life, monitor the quality of water in streams and lakes, and raise money for state parks and other department operations, said another former DNR secretary, Scott Hassett.\nMagazine fills niche\nHassett said the magazine fills an important niche that hunting and fishing journals don\'t touch. Getting rid of it would make it easier, however, for Republican elected officials to continue cutting DNR staff and budget, he said. "You have these legislators beating up the agency who don\'t know what the agency does, or they are playing on public ignorance of what the agency does," Hassett said.\nWalker\'s budget proposal said shutting down the magazine would save money not for taxpayers, but for individuals who buy conservation patron licenses. About 40,000 people each year buy the $165 licenses, which allow holders to hunt and fish, and include subscriptions to the magazine.\nAbout $6 from each patron license went to the magazine in 2015. More recent figures weren\'t available. Walker\'s proposal states that purchasers of patron licenses would save $375,000 during the two-year budget period. The $6 would be subtracted from the patron license fee.\nIn addition to the license holders, the magazine has roughly 48,000 individual subscribers who pay $8.97 a year for six issues. A 2014-15 DNR survey of 660 patron license holders found that 63 percent said they read most or all of the magazine, 25 percent read some of it and 13 percent read little or none. The survey had a margin of error of 3.7 percent.\nCredit: STEVEN VERBURG sverburg@madison.com\n'b'BERLIN * Top European leaders pledged Thursday to keep fighting against global warming as U.S. President Donald Trump announced he was pulling out of the Paris climate accord, but they rejected his suggestion that the deal could later be renegotiated.\nThe leaders of France, Germany and Italy said in a joint statement that they regretted the United States\' decision to withdraw from the accord, but affirmed "our strongest commitment" to implement its measures and encouraged "all our partners to speed up their action to combat climate change."\nWhile Trump said the United States would be willing to rejoin the accord if it could obtain more favorable terms, the three European leaders said the agreement could not be renegotiated, "since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economics."\nPresident Emmanuel Macron of France repeated that belief in an English-language speech from the presidential palace, unprecedented from a French president in an address at home. He said, "I do respect this decision but I do think it is an actual mistake both for the U.S. and for our planet."\n"Wherever we live, whoever we are, we all share the same responsibility: make our planet great again," Macron added.\nThe European Union\'s top climate change official, Miguel Arias Canente, said in a statement that Trump\'s decision to leave the Paris accord made it "a sad day for the global community," adding that the bloc "deeply regrets the unilateral decision."\nCanente also predicted that the EU would seek new alliances from the world\'s largest economies to the most vulnerable island states, as well as U.S. businesses and individuals supportive of the accord.\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement "a major disappointment" and said it was "crucial that the United States remains a leader on environmental issues," according to his spokesman.\nNorway\'s largest pension fund with 53 billion euros ($59.5 billion) in assets under its management said it would continue to invest in renewable energy despite the American president\'s decision, saying in a statement that "Donald Trump is jumping off a train that has already left the station."\nChief executive Odd Arild Grefstad cited the growth of renewable energy in U.S. states such as Texas, New York and California as signs that "the world has started the transition from fossil to a renewable economy."\nIn Mexico, former President Vicente Fox criticized Trump\'s move, saying on Twitter: "He\'s declaring war on the planet itself."\nThe U.S. Conference of Mayors said it strongly opposed Trump\'s action and vowed to continue efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming.\nBefore Trump announced his decision Thursday afternoon, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told reporters during a visit to Berlin that fighting global warming was a "global consensus" and an "international responsibility."\nWithout mentioning the U.S. specifically, Li said that "China in recent years has stayed true to its commitment" and pointed out that his was one of the first countries to ratify the 2015 Paris Agreement.\nWhile traveling abroad last week, Trump was repeatedly pressed to stay in the deal by European leaders and Pope Francis. Withdrawing would leave the United States as one of just three countries outside the agreement. The two others are Syria and Nicaragua.\nRussia joined the chorus speaking out for the climate accord. Speaking to reporters on Thursday before Trump\'s decision was announced, a spokesman for President Vladimir Putin said Russia "thinks highly" of the accords and sees no alternative to it.\nCredit: KIRSTEN GRIESHABER and FRANK JORDANS; Associated Press\nCaption: Dallas Morning News/TNS graphic - HOW IMPORTANT WAS U.S. COOPERATION TO THE PARIS AGREEMENT? The Paris Agreement\'s central aim is to keep a global temperature rise this century below 2 degrees Celsius and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The agreement by itself is not sufficient to meet the 2-degree goal; negotiators hoped to strengthen the nations\' commitments over time. The U.S. emissions reduction pledge under the agreement had accounted for more than a fifth of all emissions avoided through 2030 (21 percent of the total pledged by all nations). > If U.S. emissions follow the business-as-usual scenario instead of meeting the Paris pledge, while all other countries fulfill their commitments (and no further action is taken), it\'s estimated the world would warm an additional 0.3C (about half a degree Fahrenheit) by 2100.

Yet, their suggested form of analysis outside their narrow model. Already counted in the hundreds of thousands a year are deaths associated with crop failures and food scarcity, heat waves and forced relocation. The several-year East African drought may be a harbinger of what\'s to come. Malaria, Zika and dengue among other diseases spread as a warmer climate extends the range mosquitoes travel.\nThe authors\' analysis neglects environmental damage and ecosystem disruption that enters a spiraling feedback loop. Even if you do not believe that humans have a responsibility to stewards of the earth, certainly the damage to systems that support human life should be factored into the equation.\nPaul Susman\nLewisburg, Pa.\nWar, disease and chaos are exactly the stresses to which unchecked climate change will lead. Environmental degradation caused by climate change will drive food shortages, disease, migrations and wars. Even Defense Secretary James Mattis stated in his congressional testimony that "climate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today."\nStephanie Doba\nBrooklyn, N.Y.\nTo assert that carbon dioxide "hurts nobody\'s health" is ignorant. Humans exhale carbon dioxide as a waste product. C02 is linked to myriad deleterious health ailments including respiratory conditions. As a greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide also traps heat in the atmosphere, which contributes to the rising sea level and disrupts weather patterns.\nTed Millar\nMilton, N.Y.\nBillions of years of evolution have created a perfectly balanced ecosystem that sustains life as we know it. Extracting and burning fossil fuel, along with deforestation, disrupts that critical balance.\nThe authors note that pollution and declining wildlife habitats are problems, but they fail to connect these to climate change. The policies that cause climate change also cause pollution and loss of habitats. Fracking emits volatile organic compounds. Pipelines carrying fuel and fracking chemicals leak into waterways and aquifers, and pipeline compressors emit toxins into the air. Habitats are being lost everyday to fossil-fuel drilling. Focusing only on the economics of climate change is fundamentally flawed.\nLisa Harrison\nNew York\nExamining data over the past 21 centuries we see that sometimes we have experienced more-than-average warming and sometimes more-than-average cooling. That fact makes me suspect that eliminating activities that generate CO2 will not do away with climate change.\nThere is a lot of uncertainty regarding the benefits of fighting climate change, but there is more certainty about the costs. Proponents of the Paris agreement estimate that full compliance would reduce the global temperature by 0.17 degrees Celsius by 2100, but that\'s hardly worth the cost. There is no use being Don Quixotes fighting windmills.\nTico Moreno\nSanibel Island, Fla.\nClimate change is the greatest world-wide threat humanity has ever faced. If we do not implement effective solutions soon, we are likely to encounter devastating social, environmental and economic consequences.\nLarry Kramer\nSan Juan Capistrano, Calif.\n'b'A climate change meeting in Atlanta on Thursday had all the ingredients of a political spectacle.\nWith Donald Trump, a noted skeptic of climate change science winning the White House, a nervous federal agency scrapped plans to host the event. Enter Al Gore. The former vice president helped revive the conference and took to the podium Thursday to talk about his signature issue.\nBut it was science -- not politics -- that carried the day.\nIn the climate and health meeting held at The Carter Center, Gore, a former Democratic presidential candidate, steered clear of mentioning Trump. Instead, he stressed that climate changes could render parts of the Middle East -- including some of the holiest cities on the planet -- uninhabitable. It could also cause deadly health problems and reduce life expectancy. Those in poverty will be hardest hit, he said.\nThe event was supposed to be a three-day conference held at the Centers for Disease Control. But when that event was cancelled following the presidential election, Gore helped organize a condensed, one-day meeting instead.\nGore urged scientists and health care providers to unite in efforts to combat the effects of climate change.\nAmong the most serious problems presented to conference attendees was the belief that the rising heat index could make parts of the world uninhabitable, Gore said.\n"This is a relatively new finding, that in some areas of the Middle East and north Africa, there will be, according to the scientific predictions, areas that will no longer be fit for human habitation -- beyond the limits for human survival," Gore said. "The holy cities of Mecca and Medina are in this zone. Two years in Iran, the heat index -- the combination of temperature and humidity -- reached 165 degrees Fahrenheit.\n"No human being can live for more than a few hours outdoors in those conditions," Gore said.\nDespite the gloomy outlook, Gore said there are ways to deal with the effects of climate change, but those will take collaboration both in the U.S. and abroad.\n"We do have the solutions at hand,"Gore said. "Hope is justified.We are going to win this. We have solutions that are now readily available."\nExperts from Columbia University, Harvard University, the University of Wisconsin the World Health Organization and the CDC were among the speakers and panelists at the fast-paced conference.\n"We\'re doing three days in one day," Gore joked at the microphone during sessions.\nAtlanta resident Cindy Powell, who has worked in critical care, attended the conference because she\'s returning to school and is interested in public health. She was saddened the initial conference was cancelled, but said Thursday\'s meeting was a resilient effort.\n"It\'s better than nothing. It\'s a start," Powell said. "The positive forces of the world intend to move forward regardless."\nLeslie Bass, a commercial photography student, didn\'t know exactly what she\'d be attending as part of an internship. But she was shocked at the staggering numbers of health issues and deaths related to climate changes.\n"This is way bigger than politics, but politics in our country are going to hinder progress," Bass said. "It\'s not some myth. These are not alternative facts."\nCredit: STAFF\n'b'The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it recently postponed a gathering it had planned to hold next month on the effects of climate change on health.\nThe agency informed partner organizations and participants after Donald Trump was elected president, but before he was inaugurated. The CDC took the step out of caution rather than responding to a directive from the incoming administration, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Trump has called climate change a hoax  and vowed late last year to cut off funding of international climate-change initiatives.\nThe Climate Change and Health Summit was organized to bring scientists and public-health practitioners together to discuss implementing climate-related health initiatives such as heat-wave-preparedness plans, predicting and monitoring the spread of infectious disease, emergency preparations for severe weather and other issues, said Howard Frumkin, a former director of the CDC Center for Environmental Health and a professor of environmental and occupational health sciences at the University of Washington School of Public Health. Dr. Frumkin was among those who were invited to attend the conference.\nThe CDC made the decision itself to cancel the meeting, he said. "It\'s a truly important science-based health topic," he said. "If this heralds an era for timidity about controversial issues, then we all need to be worried."\nGeorges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, one of the partners in the summit, said "there were lots of discussions" with the CDC and other partners after the election about whether to go ahead with the summit, given the president-elect\'s stated views on climate change. "Everybody was concerned about how this would be perceived," he said.\nThe CDC said that it began notifying registered participants on Dec. 22 that it would "postpone" the meeting. But it gave no reasons for halting plans for the meeting, and was vague about rescheduling. "We are exploring options to reschedule the meeting while considering budget priorities for fiscal year 2017" as well as an American Public Health Association meeting on the same topic this year, the agency said.\nDr. Benjamin said he hoped that the summit can be rescheduled for later in the year, even if it is incorporated into the APHA\'s annual meeting in November.\nNews of the CDC\'s decision on the summit was reported Monday by E&E news, a publication for energy and environment professionals.\nWrite to Betsy McKay at  betsy.mckay@wsj.com\nRelated\n* Trump Administration Aims to Reverse Obama\'s Climate Agenda  (Jan. 22, 2017)\n* Trump Meets With Al Gore on Climate Issues Amid Pressure From His Children  (Dec. 5, 2016)\n* Donald Trump\'s Victory Injects Uncertainty Into Climate Accord  (Nov. 9, 2016)\nCredit: By Betsy McKay\n'b'Perry says ocean waters responsible \nMatthew Daly \nThe Associated Press [Eth]WASHINGTON \nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry said Monday he does not believe carbon dioxide is a primary contributor to global warming, a statement at odds with mainstream scientific consensus but in line with the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. \nAsked on CNBC\'s "Squawk Box" whether carbon emissions are primarily responsible for climate change, Perry said no, adding that "most likely the primary control knob is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in." \nPerry\'s view is contrary to mainstream climate science, including analyses by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The EPA under President Donald Trump recently removed a web page that declared "carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas that is contributing to recent climate change." \nTaking down the web page came after EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, appearing on "Squawk Box" in March, said "there\'s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact" of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases on the planet. \n"So, no, I would not agree that (carbon dioxide) is a primary contributor to the global warming that we see," Pruitt said. \nThe Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, organized by the United Nations, calls carbon dioxide the biggest heat trapping force, responsible for about 33 times more added warming than natural causes. \nThe panel\'s calculations mean carbon dioxide alone accounts for between 1 and 3 degrees warming, said MIT atmospheric scientist Kerry Emanuel. \nPerry, like Pruitt, rejected the scientific consensus on climate change. \n"This idea that science is just absolutely settled and if you don\'t believe it\'s settled then you\'re somehow another Neanderthal, that is so inappropriate from my perspective," he said. \nBeing a skeptic about climate change issues is "quite all right," Perry added, saying skepticism is a sign of being a "wise, intellectually engaged person." \nRecently, The Associated Press sent Pruitt\'s comments to numerous scientists who study climate. All seven climate scientists who responded said Pruitt was wrong and that carbon dioxide is the primary driver of global warming. \nPerry, in his TV appearance Monday, said there should not be a debate about whether the climate is changing or if humans have an effect on the climate. Instead, he said the debate should be on "what are the policy changes that we need to make to affect that?" \nShaye Wolf, climate science director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said Perry "has the science exactly backward." \nFar from being a key cause of climate change, "the world\'s oceans are actually another victim of greenhouse pollution," Wolf said. "Our oceans absorb millions of tons of carbon dioxide a day, making them dangerously acidic." \nWarming oceans also put "tremendous stress on marine life," Wolf said. \nNASA and NOAA reported in January that Earth\'s 2016 temperatures were the warmest ever. The planet\'s average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the late 19th century, "a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere," the agencies said in a joint statement. \nEarlier this month, Trump announced he will withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord. The agreement signed by 195 nations in 2015 aims to decrease global carbon emissions in an effort to head off the worst predicted effects of global warming, including worsening storms, catastrophic droughts and city-drowning sea level rise. \nThe Trump administration has also moved to roll back or delay numerous rules approved by the Obama administration to cut pollution from mining operations, oil and gas wells and coal-fired power plants.\nCredit: Transporter\n'b'Arctic-Climate-South \n\'These things are costing us:\' Arctic climate change affecting the south \nBy Bob Weber \nTHE CANADIAN PRESS \nAn international summary of five year\'s worth of research on Arctic climate change concludes the top of the world is getting warmer faster than anyone thought. \nAnd if it all sounds interesting but a little far removed from southern concerns, David Barber has news for you. \n"There are very clear linkages there and they\'ve been occurring consistently for the last 10, 15 years," said Barber, one of Canada\'s top ice scientists and a prominent contributor to the report. \n"Most people don\'t understand how bad it is." \nThe report completed for the Arctic Council, the group of eight countries that ring the North Pole, was released last week. It represents the work of 90 scientists from around the world and summarizes the most recent research from 2010 to 2016. \n"Cumulative global impacts related to Arctic change are expected to be large," the document said. "Adaptation costs and economic opportunities are estimated in the tens of trillions of U.S. dollars." \nThe report concludes the Arctic continues to warm at twice the pace of mid-latitudes and is likely to see warming of up to five degrees Celsius as early as 2040. \nBy then, the report says, summer sea ice is likely to be a thing of the past. Glaciers and ice caps will continue to melt and contribute to continually rising seas. \nMelting permafrost will affect everything from resource development to freshwater flows to climate feedbacks from the release of stored carbon. \nThen there\'s this: "There are emerging impacts of Arctic change on mid-latitude weather/climate." \nBarber\'s already seeing it. \nLast spring, he was on an Arctic voyage on the Coast Guard\'s research icebreaker, the Amundsen, when the trip had to be cancelled because the ship was pressed into weeks of search-and-rescue duty. Massive chunks of sea ice up to eight metres thick - ice that had migrated all the way from the Lincoln Sea north of Ellesmere Island - were threatening the maritime crab-fishing fleet \n"It should not have been there," Barber said. "It was sinking little fishing vessels. It was causing problems with tankers stuck in the ice." \nBreakdowns in the normal weather patterns in the High Arctic were allowing heavy, dangerous ice to drift further south. \n"We expect this to happen more often in the future." \nBarber said at least 15 new academic papers add weight to the theory that the loss of sea ice is causing changes in the upper atmosphere that disrupt southern temperatures and rainfall. \nBarber is already advising southern agencies on questions such as how future rainfall patterns might change how much electricity can be generated from hydro dams. \n"I just came from a meeting with Manitoba Hydro where this was the main topic of discussion." \nGlobal air currents are increasingly disrupted. At one point last winter, Barber said, the North Pole was 29 degrees warmer than average. Air from California was being drawn to the top of the world. \nClimate change in the Arctic is well underway and can\'t be stopped. But the report says if nations meet their greenhouse gas reduction targets under the Paris agreement, changes in the Arctic will stabilize to a new normal some time around 2040. \n"We should have started 20 years ago," Barber said. "We didn\'t get our act together and we\'re still dicking around trying to figure out how to price carbon. \n"These things are costing us. And they\'re costing the stability of our planet."\n'b'Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., issued the following news release:\nToday, Representatives Carlos Curbelo (FL-26), Elise Stefanik (NY-21) and Ryan Costello (PA-06) led a group of House Republican colleagues in introducing a resolution that calls for using American innovation to improve environmental stewardship.\nThe lawmakers were joined by fourteen other Members of Congress: Reps.

"South Florida residents are already beginning to feel the effects of climate change in their daily lives - from chronic flooding to coral bleaching to threats to our freshwater supply in the Everglades. We cannot ignore these challenges and every Member of Congress has a responsibility to our constituents and future generations to support market-based solutions, investments, and innovations that could alleviate the effects of climate change and make our nation more resilient. Our goal with this resolution is to shift the debate from whether climate change is real toward the tangible efforts to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate its effects."\n"I am pleased to introduce this resolution with so many of my Republican colleagues and I thank them for their support on this effort," said Stefanik. "Clean energy innovation is key to addressing the serious issue of climate change. This resolution brings together the priority of addressing the risks of climate change with the importance of protecting and creating American jobs. Innovation and clean energy are key to solving both. New York\'s 21st district is the proud home of the Adirondacks and we understand that protecting our environment plays an important role in promoting economic growth and opportunity."\n"The preservation of the environment and our natural resources for future generations should be a priority for us all," said Costello, a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. "We should leverage conservative principles to develop innovative, economically viable ways to achieve this goal, including through clean energy technologies. I hope to see the Republican Climate Resolution gain momentum and be part of the solutions we advance this Congress."\nThe resolution calls for better environmental stewardship through "economically viable, and broadly supported private and public solutions to study and address the causes and effects of measured changes to our global and regional climates."\nThe text of the resolution can be found here.\nWhat They\'re Saying:\nMark Reynolds, Executive Director, Citizens\' Climate Lobby\n"The risks of climate change are far too great to get bogged down in partisan politics. With this resolution, these 17 Republicans are saying that business-as-usual is unacceptable when it comes to preserving a livable world for future generations. Hopefully, their leadership will help us turn the page and move forward on solutions to this critical problem."\nDiane Randall, Executive Secretary, Friends Committee on National Legislation (The Quaker lobby in the public interest)\n"The leadership demonstrated by the 17 co-sponsors of this Republican climate resolution is such a hopeful step forward. This resolution shows that our moral obligation to address climate change and protect vulnerable communities transcends partisanship, and that there truly is political will to address this issue from both political parties in Congress. Now, more than ever, we pray that Congress will quickly pivot the dialogue towards meaningful climate solutions."\nDavid Jenkins, President, Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship\n"The significance of this Republican climate resolution cannot be overstated. Real conservatives don\'t deny reality, they face it. They don\'t avoid problems, they tackle them head on. The resolution\'s 17 initial cosponsors are stepping up on an issue that grows more urgent every day, and showing the prudent, fact-based--and yes, conservative--leadership our nation needs. We are grateful for this important first step."\nDan Misleh, Executive Director, Catholic Climate Covenant\n"The Catholic Climate Covenant applauds the moral courage of the 17 Republican legislators who have introduced this resolution. The Catholic Church recognizes the threat that climate change poses to our common home and to human life and dignity - especially of the poor and vulnerable, and of those in future generations. We are heartened that Congress is responding to Pope Francis\'s call in his address to Congress and in Laudato Si to "enter into dialogue with all people about our common home" (Laudato Si\', no. 3). We encourage House members take the next step of joining the bipartisan House Climate Solutions Caucus."\nThe Niskanen Center\n"The sponsors of the Republican Climate Resolution understand that there is nothing conservative about ignoring the enormous risks of climate change. As conservatives, we believe the government exists to protect property rights and lives. It is clear that climate change will put both at risk for our kids and future generations. It is also clear that we have the means to significantly reduce those risks and leave a prosperous and clean future for posterity. The Niskanen Center applauds these Republicans who are looking to take positive steps forward finding practical and market-based solutions for climate change."\nKen Kimmell, President, Union of Concerned Scientists\n"I\'m heartened to see Republican House members introduce a resolution committing Congress to address climate change and base its policy decisions on science and quantifiable facts. While the resolution doesn\'t explicitly make the link to fossil fuel emissions, it shows that these Republican lawmakers are not in a state of denial about this key issue. The U.S. is seeing more extreme weather due to climate change, including flooding, droughts and wildfires, which cost taxpayers billions of dollars in damages. There\'s strength in numbers, and I hope that this sizable group of responsible leaders will have an impact on votes in Congress."\nFrancesco "Frank" Femia and Caitlin Werrell, Co-Founders and Presidents, The Center for Climate and Security\n"This resolution demonstrates that the security risks of climate change are a reality that partisanship cannot continue to obscure. The Department of Defense and intelligence community have recognized this issue across both Republican and Democratic Administrations, and it\'s heartening to see Republican policy-makers from all parts of the country acting on that."\nMindy Lubber, President, Ceres (A nonprofit mobilizing business and investor leadership for a sustainable global economy)\n"Today\'s announcement sends a loud and clear message that addressing climate change need not be a partisan issue. We applaud all lawmakers - no matter their party affiliation - who recognize the urgency of tackling climate change and the enormous economic opportunities of accelerating clean energy in all parts of the United States. The cosponsors of this resolution have shown bold leadership, and we look forward to working with them to craft bipartisan climate solutions that Americans want and expect from Washington."\nLynn Scarlett, Managing Director of Public Policy, The Nature Conservancy\n"As a science-driven organization, The Nature Conservancy strongly supports actions to address climate change. We appreciate the leadership of Reps. Stefanik, Curbelo, and Costello and their fellow members of Congress in recognizing the consequences of a changing climate and calling for solutions to this challenge."\nThe Rev. Mitch Hescox, President/CEO, The Evangelical Environmental Network (EEN)\n"We are proud of the courageous leadership of Rep. Elise Stefanik (NY-21), Rep. Carlos Curbelo (FL-26), Rep. Ryan Costello (PA-6), and the 14 other Republican co-sponsors of this House Resolution affirming that climate change is a serious problem that must be addressed in order for us to be "good stewards of our environment ...". We heartily concur and stand ready to support efforts to do so".\nHeather Reams, Managing Director, Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions\n"Addressing climate change through clean energy solutions is smart policy and smart politics. Time and again, CRES polling shows that voters overwhelming support lawmakers who prioritize clean energy to advance the economy, create good paying jobs, promote energy independence, and protect the environment."\nAdmiral Frank "Skip" Bowman, U.S. Navy (ret), Member of the Advisory Board, The Center for Climate and Security, Former Director of the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program: "I support this Republican Climate Resolution. Putting aside arguments of cause and effect, there are measured and measurable data and global events that must be considered and accounted for in our defense planning."\nRear Admiral David W. Titley, U.S. Navy (ret), Member of the Advisory Board, The Center for Climate and Security, Former Oceanographer of the Navy: "I\'m very excited to see the Republican Climate Change Resolution introduced to the Congress. Our nation\'s long-term security is critically dependent on moving away from fossil-based fuels to lessen the worst risks of climate change. This change will not happen without support and leadership from the Congress, in partnership with the Administration. The Republican Climate Change Resolution is a good first step towards a serious bi-partisan policy discussion."\nCommander David "Deke" Slayton, U.S. Navy (ret), Member of the Advisory Board, The Center for Climate and Security: "The Republican Climate Resolution ably and well serves as an imperative and call for action for our Nation. The resolution captures the issues of an observable, changing climate and the dynamic events we see unfolding in the worlds oceans today. These critical events demand U.S. Congressional and national executive leadership, now. "\nSherri Goodman, Member of the Advisory Board, The Center for Climate and Security, Former Deputy Undersecretary of Defense: "The Republican Climate Resolution, whose signers represent a broad cross-section of America affected by climate change, from our coasts to rural agricultural areas, soundly recognizes that climate change is a "threat multiplier" that will adversely affect our national security interests as well as all Americans, where we live and work. The leaders of this effort should be commended for recognizing that we need both to study and address changes in our global and regional climates, and build more resilient communities for America\'s future."\nVice Admiral Lee Gunn, U.S. Navy (ret): "I am enthusiastically adding my support for this Republican Climate Resolution (Ms. Stefanik, et al., \'Expressing the commitment of the House of Representatives to conservative environmental stewardship.\'). The resolution acknowledges, among other things, the enormous national security importance of stewardship of the environment for America. Our armed services depend on predictable conditions at home for training, maintenance, drills and exercises, and bases, all components of building ready military forces. Also, the demands worldwide on not only our military but our economic, diplomatic and political power, demands on all elements of our national power, will inevitably be greater if the environment becomes less predictable. The Republican Climate Resolution supports not only traditional American values, but the practical imperative of maintaining our security at home and abroad."\nColonel Lawrence Wilkerson, U.S. Army (ret), former chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell, Visiting Professor of Government and Public Policy, the College of William and Mary: "The Republican Climate Change Resolution being introduced in the Congress--the Gibson Resolution under new leadership--symbolizes my political party\'s recognition of climate change\'s impact on national security, an impact already being felt from the shipyards at Hampton Roads to the Ship Channel in Houston, Texas. Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and her 16 Republican co-sponsors are to be congratulated for their herculean efforts to bring my political party to a firm recognition of these risks."\nContact: Joanna Rodriguez, 202/225-2778, joanna.rodriguez@mail.house.gov\n07J-Bautista-5806064 07J-Bautista\nJoanna Rodriguez, 202/225-2778, joanna.rodriguez@mail.house.gov\n'b'By David Folland\nFor the Deseret News\n"The NASA Cassini Mission has ended."

We\'ve got Marula trees here, baobabs, the most beautiful thorn trees and the sandveld. It\'s tough and it\'s harsh, but we live here because we want to." \nBut unfortunately, says Greyling, with a wry laugh, "God chose this place under the most beautiful piece of the bushveld to put 300 years of coal." \nHer farm is not far from Eskom\'s Medupi coal-fired power station and the Matimba power station in Lephalale, and other large coal-mining projects. \nThese projects - like the proposed Thabametsi coal-fired power station - threaten to destroy the Waterberg as she knows it, she says. \n"There are a lot of planned coal mining and power activities in our area. \n"We don\'t say don\'t develop, but why is it that in this most beautiful part of the bushveld you must dig up and pollute for coal?" she says. \nOn Thursday, her opposition to the Department of Environmental Affairs\' green light for the Thabametsi power station will play out in the high court in Pretoria, in what has been referred to as South Africa\'s first landmark climate change lawsuit. \nThere, Earthlife Africa Johannesburg (ELA), an environmental lobby group, represented by the Centre for Environmental Rights (CER), will challenge the environmental authorisation by Minister of Environmental Affairs Edna Molewa for the 12 000MW Thabametsi station near Lephalale. \n"There\'s hopelessness among us, the people of the Waterberg, because of the size of the fight we\'re in for," says Greyling. \n"We\'re up against such big companies. But we\'re so thankful that the grand CER lawyers found it in their heart to join our fight, because we started to feel totally helpless." \nThe Waterberg has been earmarked under the Infrastructure Development Act as a catalyst for unlocking the northern mineral belt. \nBut environmentalists have long warned that the region\'s coal-mining boom threatens its natural environment, scarce water supplies - and the health of its inhabitants. \nThe Thabametsi case, says the centre, represents the first time that the judiciary will be required to consider the importance of and need for assessment of climate change impacts for a power station. \nMolewa, as part of her decision on an appeal by ELA on Thabametsi\'s environmental authorisation, required Thabametsi to conduct a climate change impact assessment. But Molewa upheld the authorisation "despite these impacts having not been assessed". \nThat is why the ELA instituted proceedings last year to challenge Molewa, arguing that she should have set aside the authorisation, pending an adequate assessment of the climate change impacts. \nThe government has signed and ratified international agreements committing South Africa to the global effort to combat climate change and recognises that coal-fired power stations are the single-largest source of this country\'s greenhouse-gas emissions. \nTheir application, then, turns on a "crisp" question. "Is it necessary to properly assess the climate change impacts of a proposed coal-fired power station before such environmental authorisation is granted in terms of the National Environmental Management Act? \n"If the answer is yes... it\'s clear that the present review must succeed... because, in the present case, environmental authorisation was granted without any proper climate change assessment having been done." \nNicole Loser, a CER attorney, says the hope is that this case will help set a precedent for a comprehensive climate change impact assessment to be a requirement for all proposed coal-fired power stations "and ideally, for all developments which have the potential to have similar climate change impacts". \nEarthlife Africa Johannesburg programme officer Makoma Lekalaka agrees: "In five to 10 years, the Waterberg could become polluted like Witbank and the Vaal, and the quality of life will deteriorate. We don\'t want that." \nBut the department maintains there is no requirement prescribed in the law for a climate change impact assessment to be undertaken. \nClimate change impacts were adequately assessed as part of the power plant\'s environmental impact assessment process. \nYet a draft climate change impact assessment, released at the end of January, finds it will have "very large" greenhouse gas emissions, judged by international standards, and substantial climate change impacts. It will generate about 8.2 million tons of carbon dioxide each year and more than o million tons of carbon dioxide in its lifetime, and there will be increased water scarcity. \nThe centre says this report shows that Thabametsi\'s environmental impact report "failed woefully" to assess the impacts. \nThe DEA argues that South Africa is "currently heavily dependent on coal... as well as being reliant on a significant proportion of its liquid fuels being generated from coal". \nAny policy-driven transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient society must "take into account and emphasise its overriding priority to address poverty and inequality". \nWhile coal-fired power stations are heavy greenhouse gas emitters, some measure of coal-generated energy is necessary to meet the country\'s and medium-term energy needs. \nThe Thabametsi power company responds in its court documents of February 2 that the court action is a strategy by ELA to halt the creation of any new coal-fired power stations. \n"It would be manifestly unfair to hold Thabametsi to the conduct of a climate change impact assessment as a jurisdictional prerequisite to the grant of its environmental authorisation. \n"To do so would be to impose an obligation that has been deliberately withheld from the regulatory regime. It would also serve to bind Thabametsi to more onerous obligations than have been applied to its competitors." \nIts climate change impact assessment confirms it will be cleaner and more efficient than existing Eskom plants based on old technology, it says. "While the duration, magnitude and probability of climate change impacts are high, these impacts are small in the national and global context." \nBut Loser says the firm\'s own emissions report shows how its emissions compare unfavourably with modern coal-fired power stations. \n"Let\'s leave the coal under the ground and the bushveld as it is because none of these companies will ever be able to replace it," says Greyling.\n'b'Schedule of events\nTaos Community Auditorium, 145 Paseo del Pueblo Norte\nToy Tesla Silent Auction now to Thursday (Dec. 14)\nWednesday (Dec. 13)\n5-7 p.m. Visit artists in action as they create works of art expressing their views on Climate Change.\n5-7 p.m. Express your views on Community Art Wall\n7 p.m. Movie Minutes  Community One Minute Videos on Climate Change\n8 p.m. Movie Minutes  Community One Minute Videos on Climate Change\nThursday (Dec. 14)\n3 p.m. Climate talk by William Brown\n3:30-5:45 p.m. Artist talks\n5:45 p.m. Performance Piece by Mimi Chen Ting\n3-6 p.m. View artist Phaera Fields painted Suburban SUV\nTaos Community Auditorium\n145 Paseo del Pueblo Norte\nTaos, NM 87571\nView larger map\nCollaborative Chaos: Climate Change as Seen Through the Eyes of Taoseos is a first.\nThis unusual event is designed to provide a unique opportunity for our community to witness art speaking and to learn more about climate change.

This region plays an important role in global climate change. It is the source of large river systems. People living in the HKH region of Pakistan are annually affected by a number of climate-related hazards. These include floods, heat waves, glacial lake outburst floods, avalanches and landslides that result in extensive human and material losses.\nHe further added, a major part of the snow and ice mass of the HKH region in Pakistan is concentrated in the watersheds of the Indus basin. As a result of the rapidly changing climatic conditions, the glaciers in Pakistan are receding at a much faster rate, particularly due to rapid changes in the world's temperatures.\nHe also emphasized that dependence on natural resources is central to the livelihoods of many rural communities and degradation of ecosystems. The natural habitats in the mountainous region of Pakistan will shrink and shift under global warming, putting the survival of species like snow leopards, brown bears, at risk of extinction in the wild. Increases in snow and glacier melt, coupled with extreme climatic events, will adversely impact habitats through increase in intensity and frequency of floods. Mountain communities living in the proximity of glacier lakes and glacier-fed rivers are particularly at risk. There is an opportunity to alleviate poverty by maintaining the health of ecosystems on which these communities depend.\nHe also highlighted that the National Climate Change Policy mentions about the most likely climate change risks to the mountain areas of Pakistan, such as: Increase in frequency and intensity of precipitation, resulting in more frequent flash floods and landslides; Increase in intensity of wind storms; Increase in temperature, resulting in rapid glacier melting and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) and change in cropping patterns.\nHe also told the participants that Pakistan is taking number of initiatives including development of a program to prevent crop damage due to unexpected weather changes, Introduction of short duration food crops suited for high altitude, introduction of new feedstock technology for livestock, slope stabilization is a part of all road construction projects to minimize landslides, Restrictions on illegal trade of timber and other development activities detrimental to mountain ecology, Protection of agricultural terraces from extreme soil erosion, wind, hailstorm and snowstorm related dam, Building vegetative barriers for combating rangeland erosion and increasing forest cover.\nHe also emphasized It is expected that the aforementioned efforts will contribute towards overcoming the adverse effects of climate change in mountain areas and improve livelihoods of the local communities. Pakistan will indeed avail this opportunity to learn from other country parties to further increase support for the mountain communities.\nThe event was also attended by Mr. Anwer Hossain Manju minister for environment and Forests, Government of Bangladesh, Mr.Dashu Chencho Norbu, Secretary for National Environment Commission, Government of Bhutan, Mr.Shri Chandra Kishore Mishra, secretary for Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change ,Mr. Shri Chandra Kishore Mishra, Secretary for Ministry of Environment, government of Nepal, Mr. Qingchen Chao, Professor Deputy Director General, National Climate Centre China metrological Administration.\n"b'President Donald Trump\'s decision to exit the Paris climate accord, announced Thursday, is only the beginning of a multiyear process for extricating the U.S. from the deal, which was signed by most nations around the world. Here\'s how the withdrawal is likely to unfold, if Mr. Trump follows through on his plan:\n* According to the Paris agreement , countries can only exit three years after the effective date of the deal. That was Nov. 4, 2016, 30 days after a sufficient number of countries ratified the deal, which was reached in Paris in December 2015.\n* The Paris climate accord was reached as part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC, which took effect in 1994 and includes 197 countries, including the U.S. The convention was ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1992 under former President George H.W. Bush. If Mr. Trump had taken the "nuclear option" and withdrawn from the UNFCCC, he could have taken the U.S. out of the Paris agreement in a year.\n* Starting in November 2019, Mr. Trump could send a written request to exit the Paris accord. The backers of the deal built in a delay in part to allow a global shift in climate politics to dissuade governments from exiting. The U.S. president could also change his mind by late 2019, just as the 2020 presidential campaign heats up.\n* After the UNFCCC receives Mr. Trump\'s request, the U.S. will be out of the Paris agreement after one year, or as early as November 2020.\n* The real result of Mr. Trump\'s move would only be apparent in 2025, when the targets of the Paris agreement become effective. The nonbinding U.S. target  was to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels. U.S. emissions in 2025 will depend on what Mr. Trump and other officials and courts do with domestic regulations governing coal power plants and vehicle efficiency.\n* Environmental groups say the Paris agreement was designed to be durable, and a future U.S. administration could get Washington back into the pact, assuming the U.S. stays in the underlying UNFCCC.\n* Mr. Trump said Thursday the U.S. could renegotiate the Paris agreement or enter under new terms. But experts say such a process would be difficult, since nearly all nations agreed on the deal in 2015, and leading economies have said they would continue with the original deal if the U.S. leaves.\nWrite to William Mauldin at  william.mauldin@wsj.com\nCredit: By William Mauldin\n'b'Climate change\nMUCH ado from both sides on climate change however none of the arguments for or against make sense.\nWe cannot trust Government Agencies, NASA, CSRIO, BOM, or any other organisation with government funding for accurate reports, due to the fact that their agenda is to prove only one side of the argument.\nIn reality, if there is indeed climate change caused by humans, the reason is scientifically and statistically proven to be consumerism.\nIf there was no demand, there would be no manufacturing and therefore no carbon emissions.\nIt is entirely up to consumers to limit their own emissions to "save the planet" however no one is willing.\nExample: The average carbon emitted by the mobile phone user is 1250kg per year and global emissions total 125 million tonnes.\nAnswer: Government should restrict the use of mobile phones by legislation to 5 minutes per day.\nOne solar panel costs 1809kg (978 grams per kilowatt) of carbon to produce which never repays the cost during its 20 year lifespan.\nAnswer: modern coal fired electricity is more efficient @846 grams per kilowatt\nIt costs 35 tonnes of carbon to produce the average SUV, which for most owners has no more than a 5 year life span.\nAnswer: Limit the size of vehicles to one litre engine capacity with only one purchase every ten years.\nA flat screen television produces 270 kilograms of carbon per year.\nAnswer: Limit viewing to one hour per day.\nGoogle search: 7 grams of carbon are produced for each Google Search.\nAnswer: limit Google Searches to one per day.\nThese few are just the "tip of the iceberg".\nAll of these emissions can be controlled by government legislation by limiting out of control consumerism.\nWhen will our leaders take action?\nBRIAN SAYERS, Millmerran\nEnd of the world\nHARDLY a month goes by that one does not hear from yet another doom-sayer claiming the world is about to end.\nThe latest crackpot self-styled astronomer Dr Dyomin Damir Zakharovich claims that a massive asteroid is about to strike the Earth next month and accusing NASA of a cover up and lying through their teeth.\nTrust me, there will be no tsunami causing asteroid strike next month and the world is not coming to an end. There is no credible scientific evidence that such an event will occur in the near future.\nThese self-styled crackpots are spreading false information and pseudo-science that is undermining the teaching of real science.\nI wonder where "Dr" Zakharovich received his doctorate.

Since 2012, he has choked through the harshest drought to hit the Great Plains in a century, punctuated by freakish snowstorms and suffocating gales of dust. His planting season starts earlier in the spring and pushes deeper into winter.\nTo adapt, he has embraced an environmentally conscious way of farming that guards against soil erosion and conserves precious water. He can talk for hours about carbon sequestration -- the trapping of global-warming-causing gases in plant life and in the soil -- or the science of the beneficial microbes that enrich his land.\nIn short, he is a climate change realist. Just don\'t expect him to utter the words "climate change."\n"If politicians want to exhaust themselves debating the climate, that\'s their choice," Mr. Palen said, walking through fields of freshly planted winter wheat. "I have a farm to run."\nHere in north-central Kansas, America\'s breadbasket and conservative heartland, the economic realities of agriculture make climate change a critical business issue. At the same time, politics and social pressure make frank discussion complicated. This is wheat country, and Donald J. Trump country, and though the weather is acting up, the conservative orthodoxy maintains that the science isn\'t settled.\nSo while climate change is part of daily conversation, it gets disguised as something else.\n"People are all talking about it, without talking about it," said Miriam Horn, the author of a recent book on conservative Americans and the environment, "Rancher, Farmer, Fisherman." "It\'s become such a charged topic that there\'s a navigation people do."\nMr. Palen -- he plays his politics close to his vest but allows that he didn\'t vote for Hillary Clinton -- and others here in Glen Elder and across the state illustrate the delicate dance.\nFarmers like him focus on practical issues like erosion or dwindling aquifers. "When you don\'t get the rainfall, it\'s tough times," he said.\nRegional politicians and business leaders speak of pursuing jobs that clean energy may create, rather than pressing the need to rein in carbon emissions. A science teacher at a community college -- whose deeply religious students sometimes express doubts about the trustworthiness of science that contradicts biblical teachings -- speaks to his class about the positives of scientific discovery (electricity) in order to ease into more contentious subjects (global warming).\nAnd an editor for a closely followed agriculture magazine, Successful Farming, recently made a controversial move, drawing a flurry of angry letters: He broke with longstanding policy to address climate change head-on.\n"Some readers thanked us," the editor Gil Gullickson said. "But some wondered whether we\'d been hijacked by avid environmentalists."\nThe climate has not always been such a partisan issue. Richard Nixon, a Republican president, set up the Environmental Protection Agency and signed the Clean Air Act. Ronald Reagan ushered in the Montreal Protocol, the first global treaty to protect the global atmosphere.\nMuch of that consensus has broken down, in no small part because of a well-financed push by fossil-fuel interests, together with influential Republican allies, to attack well-established research on topics like global warming and push back on environmental regulation. That push began in earnest during the George W. Bush administration as attempts to undercut the Clean Air Act, and since then, the divide has widened.\nPresident Trump has famously said he believes that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese, and his administration has purged nearly all mention of climate-change programs from the White House and State Department websites. It has also ordered a freeze on federal grant spending at the E.P.A. and other government agencies.\nThe fact that the climate-change discourse has also become dominated by liberals has alienated some conservatives, including Mr. Palen. Many people here in particular resent how, in the polarized political landscape of recent years, conservative Americans have been painted as hostile to the environment.\nThe Trump campaign successfully seized on that schism, painting Democrats as overzealous environmentalists with little sympathy for the economic realities or social mores of rural America. "Many of our federal environmental laws are being used to oppress farmers instead of actually helping the environment," Mr. Trump quipped in a widely circulated Q. and A. on FarmFutures.com. "Farmers care more for the environment than the radical environmentalists."\nStill, "it would be a huge mistake to think people voting for Trump were voting against the environment," Ms. Horn said. If Trump follows an aggressive anti-environment agenda, she said, "there will be a big backlash in the heartland."\nDefender of the Soil\nIn many ways, Mr. Palen sees himself as the ultimate conservationist. His great-grandfather, the son of an immigrant from Luxembourg, was the first to farm in this stretch of north-central Kansas.\nMr. Palen grew up on the farm, took it over in his 20s, and looked to make his mark. In college, he learned of a farming technique called "no till," which is intended to more closely mimic the natural prairie ecosystem, and was intrigued by its promise to protect his family fields from Kansas\' relentless winds and sudden downpours. The idea behind no-till farming, he now explains to anyone who will listen, is that plowing the soil destroys its natural structure, causing it to lose its precious moisture and nutrients. That makes it vulnerable to erosion.\nMr. Palen\'s fields aren\'t tilled. There are no neat furrows. The residue of plants from previous plantings still carpets the earth, offering a layer of protection, and his fields are never bare even after harvest. He alternates wheat and other crops with what he describes as a cocktail of grasses and leafy plants, like grain sorghum, sunflowers and alfalfa, a gesture toward the diversity of the wild prairie. "They say there\'s more organisms in a handful of soil than people on the planet," Mr. Palen said, making his way through a field between plantings. He stooped his tall frame down, dug up a clump of earth, and rolled it between his fingers. He is soft-spoken, yet when he talks of the earth, his excitement is obvious.\n"See how it\'s firm and holds together?" he said. "See how it doesn\'t break down into goo?"\nNo-till farming addresses a dire problem facing American farmers: Almost 1.7 billion tons of topsoil are blown or washed off croplands a year, according to the Department of Agriculture, resulting in billions of dollars in losses for farmers. Keeping the soil healthy and covered also reduces evaporation by 80 percent, helping farmers conserve water, the department estimates.\nFarmers like Mr. Palen also happen to be protecting a vast and valuable carbon sink, making him an ally to climate-change campaigners. The soil traps far more carbon in its depths than all plant and animal life on the earth\'s surface, scientists estimate. A 2013 study estimated that no-till and other restorative farming methods could achieve up to 15 percent of the total carbon reduction needed to stabilize the climate.\nDespite his conservationist streak, Mr. Palen has no affinity for environmentalists. He feels vilified, he says, for his continued use of chemical herbicides and pesticides. (Some organic farmers control weeds by tilling the soil, which Mr. Palen argues causes more ecological harm.) And he remains suspicious of any expansion of government regulations that ignore realities of rural America.\n"We want to be left alone," Mr. Palen said. He singled out the Clean Water Rule, an E.P.A. regulation designed to protect streams and other waterways, as regulatory overreach. Washington types wanted to dictate what he could do with every creek, every puddle, on his farm, he said, putting impossible burdens on farmers.\nAnd most of them had probably never spent any time on a farm, he said. "We\'re the ones working to protect the environment. We\'re the ones whose lives are tied to the earth."\nHoning Scientific Strategy\nCarl Priesendorf, a science teacher at Metropolitan Community College in Kansas City, Mo., has learned strategies to talk about climate change without completely alienating climate skeptics. He teaches geology and meteorology. Those subjects would usually be innocuous, but not here.\n"I\'d show the CO2 data -- how we\'d had the hottest year on record," Mr. Priesendorf said. "But I get students who basically say what I\'m teaching is nonsense. My car\'s been keyed. I get notes from students saying they\'re praying for my soul." One such note that he shared reads, "Know that God\'s love surpasses knowledge."\nSince a particularly contentious debate in class -- a student threw a book bag at him, he said -- Mr. Priesendorf has taken a step back to focus on the everyday positives of science. "I ask: \'Do you like the light bulb? Do you like electricity?\' That\'s science," he said. "Then I ease into more contentious topics, like climate change."\nThat is an uphill battle. A 2013 survey found that just 8 percent of farmers in the Midwest believed that "climate change is occurring, and it is caused mostly by human activities." An earlier Pew Research Center poll found that only 48 percent of people in the Midwest agree with the statement that there is "solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer," a number below other regions in the country.\nAnd conservatives have been pushing back against classroom standards adopted by the state of Kansas that treat evolution and climate change as scientific concepts. Last year, the United States Supreme Court declined to review a nonprofit group\'s lawsuit that claimed that those standards promote atheism.\nBut now, under a Trump administration, Mr. Priesendorf felt science itself was under fire. "If even your government starts telling your country that scientists are lying to you, it\'ll be even tougher for science teachers," he said. "I\'m going to focus on keeping my students\' minds open to the possibility that the science is correct."\nLawmaker Forges Alliances\nAnnie Kuether, a Democrat and clean-energy advocate in the Republican-controlled Statehouse and a member of the State Utilities Committee, has for years pushed for more renewable energy. One obstacle, though, is that the committee\'s chairman does not believe in climate change.\nA St. Louis native who landed in Topeka as a young bride four decades ago, Ms. Kuether is used to working alongside adversaries. Her county voted for Mr. Trump, along with all but two counties in the state.\nShe has sat through committee meetings where climate skeptics, including the discredited scientist Wei-Hock Soon, blasted the science behind global warming. "Carbon Dioxide, CO2, is merely a bit player in climate change," reads one slide Mr. Soon presented in 2013. "Rising CO2 is largely beneficial to plant and human life."\n"I remember being horrified," Ms. Kuether said.\nStill, over the years, she has forged powerful business alliances by focusing, in her arguments, on jobs and the economy. She has also found increasing support from farmers and landowners who count on wind turbines and solar panels they host on their property for income.\n"Gradually, from a political standpoint, you can build a constituency that benefits from this industry," said Mark Lawlor, one ally and an executive at Clean Line Energy Partners, which is building a 780-mile  transmission line to deliver 4,000 megawatts of wind power from western Kansas to Missouri, Illinois and other neighboring states.\n"Just like grain, cattle, airplanes, wind\'s another valuable resource Kansas can export," he said, referring to Kansas\' sizable agricultural industry, as well as the Cessna Aircraft Company, which is based in Wichita, Kan. "Kansas has a lot of pragmatic folks here, and we recognize benefits."\nKansas\' dwindling water sources have been another issue that Ms. Kuether has found strikes a nerve among voters here, whatever their beliefs on climate change. That has helped to build some support for measures to save the state\'s shrinking aquifers, a lifeline for communities in western Kansas, though not yet any decisive action.\nIn fact, her focus on the practical is a big part of what has kept getting her elected, she said, in a State Legislature where she is outnumbered by Republican lawmakers, two to one. "I\'ve always felt that families have always been concerned about water -- whether they\'re Democratic, Republican or independent," she said.\nPublication Takes a Stand\nMr. Gullickson of Successful Farming, who usually writes about topics like pigweed, gypsum and runoff, has started to push the envelope on debates over climate change. An 11-year veteran of the magazine, where he is the crops technology editor, Mr. Gullickson said he had long been on the fence about climate change. But that began changing five years ago, when he attended a workshop where a University of Kentucky professor gave a convincing argument, backed by data.\n"I started looking at the evidence, at the data and what farmers were doing," he said. "And it\'s clear: The weather has become more extreme these days. And I thought, \'I\'ve never heard of any successful business publication that stayed in business by withholding information.\'"\nSo for the first time in the storied magazine\'s 115-year-old history, a cover story squarely addressed the science of climate change. The October 2014 piece was published under the headline, "@#$*% Weather!"\n"I know what you\'re thinking: Climate change is just some figment of Al Gore\'s imagination adopted by liberal tree-huggers who want to tank the U.S. economy," Mr. Gullickson wrote.\n"Still, think back over some rough weather you\'ve endured in recent years and ask yourself these questions," he continued. "Are springs getting wetter? Are droughts increasing in severity? Are rainstorms increasing in intensity?" The clear answer, he said: "Yes."\nMr. Gullickson said that he and his editor had held lengthy discussions leading up to the article\'s publication. His editor in chief, Dave Kurns, was supportive, he said, but also warned that the piece could generate backlash.\nMr. Kurns spoke candidly over concerns of a backlash in an editor\'s note that led the issue. When he became the magazine\'s editor two years earlier, he said, he had been warned, "Never use the words \'climate change.\'"\n"I was told: \'Readers hate that phrase. Just talk about the weather,\'" he wrote.\nThe industry publication, which has a circulation of 390,000, was influenced by some of the biggest names in agriculture taking a stand on the issue, Mr. Gullickson said. The agricultural giant Cargill has started to lobby members of Congress and urged farmers to take climate change seriously, saying inaction would be detrimental to the United States economy.\nThe response to the magazine\'s take on the issues has been split.\n"When you start quoting \'climate scientists\' and the United Nations," wrote in one reader, Bill Clinger, a farmer based in Harpster, Ohio, "you are as nutty as Al Gore." Measures to control emissions, he said, "are just seductive names for socialist programs intended to micromanage people and businesses."\nMr. Gullickson said some readers thanked him. "Finally, a farming magazine comes to terms with what is going on with the weather," wrote Paul Jereczek of Dodge, Wis.\nReached by phone, Mr. Jereczek, who runs a dairy farm, expressed exasperation at people\'s inability to speak openly. "The phrase has become so politicized, it\'s just hard to talk about," he said. "But we talk about everything else. Even round here, protecting soil is such a hot topic right now. But we talk about the soil, saving fertilizer, that sort of thing."\nGrouse to the Rescue\nMark Salvo, vice president at the wildlife conservation group Defenders of Wildlife, might be a walking, talking stereotype of the kind of environmentalist who so frustrates Mr. Palen. An Oregonian now based in Washington, he spent 15 years in the American West fighting to conserve fish and wildlife on public lands.\nBut Mr. Salvo thinks he knows an unlikely -- and highly sympathetic -- character to bring Kansans and others together around climate change: the lesser prairie-chicken.\nKnown for its shock of yellow hair and bright orange cheeks, the lesser prairie-chicken once roamed the Great Plains. Today, though, the grouse is under threat -- its populations reduced to isolated pockets in western Kansas, Colorado and the Texas-New Mexico border as its habitat succumbs to climate-induced drought, farming, drilling and other human activity.\nThe group has been petitioning the Fish and Wildlife Service to relist the lesser prairie-chicken as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. The bird found itself taken off the list after a lawsuit in 2014 backed by the oil and gas industry, which argues that any protective measures would mean added costs for energy developers.\nMr. Salvo has found that to gain allies it doesn\'t always help to start with the role climate change plays in harming the bird\'s habitat. Instead, his movement has tried to find common ground, highlighting the historical heritage of the lesser prairie-chicken. In the "Little House on the Prairie" novels, Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote about eating prairie-chicken mush.\nMr. Salvo also stresses how grouse-friendly practices can be good for farming, too, backing a federal program that provides financial aid to private landowners who adopt those practices. Leaving corn stubble standing after harvest gives the birds food and places to hide, for example, while also helping farmers protect the soil.\n"Sometimes, to gain allies, it helps to focus on issues of common concern, to support local economic development as well as species conservation," he said. "It helps everybody come to the table."\nLast week, Mr. Palen, the farmer, was again talking weather -- if not climate change -- at a conference of no-till farmers  in Salina, Kan. Sessions included "Using Your Water Efficiently," "Making Weather Work for You in 2017" and "Building Healthy Soil With Mob Grazing," a practice that helps to fertilize the land.\nAnd yes, Mr. Palen says, he is on board with saving the lesser prairie-chicken. "I often think of ways I can protect their habitat," he said. "I enjoy wildlife."\nCredit: By HIROKO TABUCHI\n'b'Pakistan, Aug. 26 -- University of Agriculture Peshawar and\nNorwegian Church Aid (NCA) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)\nin pursuance of strategically important theme of Climate Change\nAdaptation.\nAccording to a press release issued here on Frinday, NCA & Climate\nChange Centre, University of Agriculture, Peshawar will conduct a\nresearch study in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province with the topic "How\nto increase resilience of the communities through exploring the Effects\nof Climate Change on the Rainfall Patterns, Existing Rainwater Management and Livelihood Practicesof Communities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP)\nProvince".\nThe research aims to enhance community resilience and come up with\npolicy level recommendation by studying the effects of Climate Change on rainfall patterns and its further implications on existing livelihood\nand rainwater management practices of the local community residing in different agro-ecological zones of KP province.\nThe study will be conducted under supervision of experienced Professors\nwho will also involve PhD. students in data collection, analysis & reporting writing.\nThis MoU will lay down the foundation for long term partnership between\nNCA and Academia in Pakistan.\nThe research study will be followed by organizing national workshop in\nwhich policy level recommendations in light of the research findings will\nbe shared with Policy makers, development experts of Govt. and other stakeholders including I/NGO\'s working in Pakistan.\nText Box Figure Prof. Dr Zahoor Ahmad Swati, Vice Chancellor, The\nUniversity of Agriculture Peshawar along with James John, Deputy Country Representative, NCA, Pakistan Signing the MoU for Collaboration in Research Study.

This annual scholarship promotes in-depth understanding of sustainability topics, research strategies and the use of library resources.\n11Y-Dash-5806827 11Y-Dash\n'b'Publication: The Poly Post\n, California State Polytechnic University - Pomona, Pomona CA.\nA team of students have stepped into the shoes of environmental researchers to find out how their peers truly feel about climate change.\nA research team led by environmental management and protection senior Ben Christensen asked 728 students to take a survey with questions about climate change.\nWe are trying to get a better sense of where Cal Poly students were in terms of their understandings and perceptions and interactions with climate change. How do we as a campus, as a student body, feel about it? Christensen said. The university is committed to a whole bunch of different sustainability goals and initiatives, and it is part of the [California State University] curriculum, so the question is Are we being successful with that?\nCreating the survey\nThe team, known as the Climate Change Action Research Group , began this project by researching how to obtain the most accurate data from the student population. According to Christensen, there was a meta analysis of data on different climate change perspectives from outside sources.\nThe team then consolidated this data into four general topics they wanted to explore further relating to student persepctives. These topics were students knowledge of environmental action strategies, students perception of their individual ability to create actionable change, students environmental attitudes and understanding and students individual sense of responsibility.\nThese topics were the inspiration for the teams official survey. It consisted of 13 statements which students responded to with a rating on a scale of 1 to 5 in which 1 corresponded with strongly disagree and 5 corresponded with strongly agree.\nAdditionally, the survey asked if students felt that climate change is a serious problem, and if they felt their peers did as well. It also asked if they currently take action to reduce their carbon footprint, and if they believe their peers do as well.\nThe Results\nAfter calculating percentages from the data they collected through their survey, CCARG drafted a 37-page report mapping the student populations overall perception of climate change.\nThe following percentages account for agree and strongly agree responses to the questions.\nBased on the CCARG survey:\n71.8 percent of students feel they know what they can do to contribute to sustainability in the community;\n87.4 percent of students are willing to make a difference on campus;\n76.6 percent of students feel a sense of responsibility to help reduce human impact on the environemt;\n94.2 percent of students believe climate change is real;\n92.1 percent of students feel climate change is a serious problem;\n74.2 percent of students believe their peers feel climate change is a serious problem;\n82.1 percent of students currently take action to make changes;\n42.7 percent of students believe their peers currently take action to make changes.\nA lot of people are actually supportive of the movement, but they just dont perceive others to be as well, Christensen said.\nThe takeaways and the goal\nThe results motivated the CCARG to push their research in a different direction.\nOverall, the student researchers believe these statistics could point students in the right direction. Environmental management and protection sophomore Logan Babcock believes it could help students to have the right mindset about climate change.\nA big takeaway for students is just being aware of your impact, because its easy to say that Cal Poly is doing enough. But since we are Cal Poly, it really is a personal choice to make an impact and educate yourselves, Babcock said.\nTheir overall goal is to use this research to spur more efforts from the Cal Poly community to focus on sustainability to make a positive environmental impact on campus.\nThe goal of [the study] is to publish the research and gear it towards policy makers on campus, people in the sustainability community who are trying to make an initiative so that we can do it in a more informed way and a more targeted way, just getting it in the right peoples hands, Christensen said.\nThe group is also looking into applying to be speakers at multiple conferences to showcase their work.\nIf the conferences happen, that is where [our research] will probably be showcased the most, Babcock said.\nThough all the results of the survey have been calculated, the paper must be edited so the research can be fully understood by faculty and others.\nThe call to action\nAlong with this research, the students are writing a call-to-action paper focusing on the need for more data regarding Cal Polys impact on the environment.\nLast year we had a couple projects going and one of them kind of just went kaput, because there wasnt any data on it. And so what we drew from that is that there needs to be data on it, Babcock said.\nCCARG member and mechanical engineering junior Jeff Wagner was a lead on this project when it started last year.\nThere is no numerical data on how much these practices help. I believe it helps and I want to prove that these practices help, but theres no data to show that, Wagner said. This was a wake-up call for us  if we want to be proactive and if we want to be truly looking towards how we best impact the environment we need to look at how we are doing right now.\nThe call-to-action paper will be formatted similarly to the research paper to influence faculty and groups to keep track of their data. CCARG knows that if faculty follows through and collects this data it can be used to understand not only what Cal Poly is doing to sustain the earth, but what the students could be doing as well.\nSince the university is involved in mandatory practices for students to learn about and understand climate change, their overall question is if these practices are working, Christensen said. We are looking to get an understanding of whether or not the sustainability in higher education is working efficiently, and what we can do in the future to impact it.\nMore statistical information will be available when the report is released by the CCARG. \nCredit: Rachel Marquardt\n'b'Publication: Arkansas Traveler, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville AR.\nIn June, two months after some Environmental Protection Agency records were removed from its website, Fayettevilles mayor was one of 364 mayors to sign an open letter to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change stating their support of the Paris Climate Agreement.\nResearch by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency about climate change, how climate change develops and its impact on the weather, was removed from the EPAs website in April. In May, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel took the information that was removed and republished it on Chicagos city website.\nCity officials in Chicago contacted Fayetteville Mayor Lioneld Jordan and the mayors of other cities across the nation for an opportunity to publish the EPA findings on their own websites, said Peter Nierengarten, Fayettevilles sustainability director.\nWe thought it was a really important component of making sure the data, the science, the information of climate change is available, Nierengarten said about Jordans decision to post the deleted research on the City of Fayettevilles website.\nUA ecological engineering professor Marty Matlock said climate change will affect his studies in hydrology and sustainability.\nMatlock came to the UofA 16 years ago to work on campus sustainability, occasionally working with Fayetteville to ensure that the growing campus did not create problems with the citys water drainage. His work in hydrology is to predict flood events, but with the changing weather patterns, he can no longer rely on data from years past, he said.\nIn the past 50 to 100 years, Arkansas has not become warmer like the rest of the country, according to the 2016 EPA publication What Climate Change Means in Arkansas. Instead, the amount of rainfall has steadily increased. Since 1958 precipitation from heavy rainfall has increased by 27 percent in the southeastern parts of the country, according to the EPA publication.\nSevere flooding caused an estimated cost of $1.7 billion in Missouri, Arkansas and southern Illinois last spring, according to the National Centers of Environmental Information. Flooding in the beginning of May cost farmers $64.5 million, according to UofA System Division of Agriculture Research and Extension.\nMost of the climate change models suggest Arkansas will get wetter, not drier, Matlock said. Heres the thing about climate change: it means hotter hots, colder colds, wetter wets, drier dries. It means extremes get more frequent."\nDuring his campaign, President Trump made promises about climate change twice during rallies in 2016. In Warren, Michigan he promised to put America first and cut funding that supported U.N. global warming programs. In June, President Trump announced that he intends to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement.\nDrake Moudy, a sophomore in the UA College Republicans, said he hopes that other Republicans who do not see the urgency of climate change would look at the economic potential of using green energy and shift towards investigating the relevance of renewable energy.\nI think that Republicans aren\'t always on the wrong side of climate change," Moudy said.\nNierengarten said the City of Fayetteville is still working on creating a two-fold plan that will reduce the emissions from city operations and help citizens reduce their own emissions. The plan is expected to be introduced to the city council this fall and discuss converting to cleaner energy sources and creating a more efficient transportation infrastructure.\nWe have to prepare for the changes in our climate to thrive as a species on our planet. I think thats a pretty imperative issue, that we need to set the politics aside and need to collaborate together with anyone and everyone to solve the climate crisis, Nierengarten said.\nOn campus, Matlock said the UofA is already working and implementing projects that are cutting down on waste. Sponsoring interns, he had a group of students analyze the impact of electric and gas-powered landscaping tools, letting them effectively change the way the campus maintains its grounds with their findings. Sustainability minors also work closely with Matlock and create capstone projects that deal with sustainability, and in 2014 the Green Revolving Fund was founded, where students can recommend projects to improve sustainability on campus.\nSince its implication, the Greek Theatre and large lecture auditoriums use LED lights that generate better light and reduce electric costs up to 90 percent in the Greek Theatre and 30 percent in auditoriums, Matlock said. The UofA is also looking to become a zero waste campus by 2021 by diverting 90 percent of its waste from landfills through education and participation in recycling programs.\n\n'b"Gov. Jerry Brown is hitting the road this week to talk about climate change on the East Coast, his office announced Friday.\nHe's scheduled to speak at multiple events in New York on Monday, including one at the United Nations.\nOn Tuesday he heads to Yale University for a panel moderated by former Secretary of State John F. Kerry. Then he'll return to New York on Wednesday for an event with former Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Later this year, Brown is attending a U.N. climate conference in Germany.\n\n-- Chris Megerian\n\n"b'The University of Manitobas multi-year, multimillion-dollar climate change study has been put on ice for a year  because of climate change itself.\nDavid Barber, the universitys renowned Arctic researcher and chief scientist of the BaySys project, said the 40 scientists on board the Canadian icebreaker CCGS Amundsen made the decision to postpone the $17-million project until next year after two weeks onboard because they realized the ship was needed elsewhere due to the continued extreme ice conditions in southern waters around Newfoundland and Labrador.\nThe icebreaker, formerly known as the Sir John Franklin, is a scientific research ship, but it can be redirected by the Canadian Coast Guard if its icebreaking capabilities are needed.\nIts the second most powerful icebreaker in the country and we had trouble getting through the sea ice, Barber, the Canada Research Chair in Arctic Systems Science at the university, said on Monday.\nTheres a lot of people who rely on it. They were helping fishing boats, supply ships bringing fuel oil to communities, oil tankers. We ended up doing a lot of this during the two and a half weeks in total we were there.\nI realized it would be dangerous for us to leave the area because it would put people at risk so we cancelled the study... this large-scale climate change study was cancelled because of climate change.\nJust last week, while Barber and the scientists were still on the Amundsen, the icebreaker was tasked with rescuing fishers on four fishing vessels from La Scie Harbour that were stuck in sea ice off Newfoundlands Baie Verte Peninsula.\nBut, within sight of the boats, the Amundsen was called off from helping after it was discovered the ice was two metres thick  too strong for it to get through.\nSome of the fishers were finally rescued by helicopter  after one of the vessels sank  while the rest made it back to port on their own.\nBarber said the scientists had already left on the Amundsen almost a week earlier than planned when the coast guard warned them the sea ice was moving and could cause them problems getting to Hudson Bay, where the research study was to take place, if they didnt leave earlier.\nBut Barber said once out on the water, the scientists realized this wasnt the usual sea ice, which would be relatively easy for the icebreaker to plow through, but thicker ice from further north which had broken free and drifted because of climate change.\nBarber said it would also have been difficult and potentially dangerous for the scientists to try to do five weeks of scientific work in the three-week window left to them.\nFor me it was easy to see the ice conditions werent just difficult, these were unprecedented ice conditions, he said.\nThe research project is looking at what effects having more fresh water from rivers flowing into Hudson Bay is having on the saltwater marine environment. But the trip wasnt wasted.\nWe had our scientific equipment so we did a detailed scientific analysis of the ice conditions, Barber said.\nThis will be very useful scientifically, but it is just a small piece of it. Its a consolation prize for us.\nkevin.rollason@freepress.mb.ca\nCredit: Kevin Rollason\n'b'Publication: The Daily Cardinal, University of Wisconsin - Madison, Madison WI.\nOne primary concern in rural areas: higher temperatures put strain on water and energy sources. AP Photo/Robert Ray\nPresident Donald Trump has the environmental community understandably concerned. He and members of his Cabinet have questioned the established science of climate change, and his choice to head the Environmental Protection Agency, former Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, has sued the EPA many times and regularly sided with the fossil fuel industry.\nEven if the Trump administration withdraws from all international climate negotiations and reduces the EPA to bare bones, the effects of climate change are happening and will continue to build.\nIn response to real threats and public demand, cities across the United States and around the world are taking action to address climate change. We might think this is happening only in large, coastal cities that are threatened by sea-level rise or hurricanes, like Amsterdam or New York.\nResearch shows, however, that even in the fly-over red states of the U.S. Great Plains, local leaders in small- to medium-size communities are already grappling with the issue. Although their actions are not always couched in terms of addressing climate change, their strategies can provide insights into how to make progress on climate policy under a Trump administration.\nMy colleagues and I did a survey of over 200 local governments in 11 states of the Great Plains region to learn about steps theyre taking to mitigate the effects of climate change and to adapt to them. We found local officials in red states responsible for public health, soil conservation, parks and natural resources management, as well as county commissioners and mayors, are concerned about climate change, and many feel a responsibility to take action in the absence of national policy.\nBut because it is such a complex and polarizing topic, they often face public uncertainty or outrage toward the issue. So while these local officials have been addressing climate change in their communities over the past decade, many of these policy activities are specifically not framed that way. As one respondent to our survey said:\nIt is my personal and professional opinion that the conservation community is on track with addressing the issue of climate change but is way off track in assigning a cause. The public understands the value of clean water and clean air. If the need to improve our water quality and air quality was emphasized, most would agree. Who is going to say dirty water and dirty air is not a problem? By making the argument climate change and humans are the cause significant energy is wasted trying to prove this. It is also something the public has a hard time sinking their teeth into.\nIn order to address the vulnerabilities facing their communities, many local officials are reframing climate change to fit within existing priorities and budget items. In a survey of mayors, we asked: In your citys policy and planning activities (for energy, conservation, natural resources management, land use, or emergency planning, etc.) how is climate change framed? The following quotes give a sense of their strategies.\nIn terms of economic benefit & resource protection. This framing was deliberate to garner support from residents who did not agree with climate change.\nWe frame the initiative as: energy savings (=$ savings), as smart growth/good planning, and as common sense natural resource management. Climate change is only explicitly referenced in our Climate Protection Plan adopted in 2009. Most initiatives fall under the "sustainability umbrella term.\n"We mask it with sustainability, we call it P3 (People, Planet, Prosperity)\nThe initial interest in climate change came about as a result of concern about the potential for poor air quality affecting economic development in the City. Air quality and climate change were framed as being extremely related issues.\nClimate change is framed as one of several benefits of conservation measures. Other benefits of conservation, recycling, walking, etc. include its good for the earth (regardless of climate change), healthful, economical, etc.\nThe results show that energy, economic benefits, common sense and sustainability are frames that are providing opportunities for local leaders to address climate change without getting stuck in the political quagmire. This strategy is being used across the Great Plains states, which include some of the most climate-skeptical areas of the country.\nEvery region of the U.S. will need to address practical questions of how states and local communities can reduce emissions and adapt to climate impacts. Under the Trump administration, it is likely any progress on U.S. climate policy will continue at these subnational levels. Thats why a variety of experts argue that we should encourage the types of pragmatic strategies now being employed by local leaders in red states.\nIn the Great Plains in particular, local officials are facing severe impacts from higher temperatures, which will place greater demands on water and energy.\nIn our research we found local leaders focus on regional and local issues such as drought, energy and flooding. These are problems that are tied to climate change, but are already a priority on the local level. And the sought-for improvements, such as energy savings, health benefit and flood management, fit well with local needs and values.\nFor example, Fargo, North Dakota mitigates some of its greenhouse gas emissions and created a new source of city revenue by capturing the methane from its landfill facility and selling that gas to the electricity company. The city trash is now providing renewable energy for local residents and an industrial facility.\nPerhaps the question facing us is: Should we reframe climate change and other environmental problems to fit the Trump administrations priorities with a strong focus on practical solution ideas? For example, Trump has stated that infrastructure projects will be a high priority. That could easily translate into fixing the drinking water crisis experienced by Flint, Michigan and many other cities where it is likely to happen; Trump has also highlighted mass transit, which could help reduce air pollution and carbon emissions.\nWith an administration eager to expand fossil fuel development and consumption, the outlook for federal action on reducing climate-altering greenhouse gases is dire. Given that, reframing climate change to address cobenefit issues seems a logical strategy, and we can look for local government leaders in red states to show the way.\nRebecca J.

"Conserving our oceans and using them sustainably is preserving life itself."\nGeneral Assembly President Peter Thomson, a Fijian diplomat, said "the time has come for us to correct our wrongful ways."\n"We have unleashed a plague of plastic upon the ocean that is defiling nature in so many tragic ways," he said. "It is inexcusable that humanity tips the equivalent of a large garbage truck of plastic into the ocean every minute of every day."\nThomson also warned that illegal and destructive fishing practices and harmful subsidies for fisheries "are driving our fish stocks to tipping points of collapse."\nAnd he said increasing human-caused carbon emissions are not only driving climate change but causing rising sea levels by warning the oceans and making them more acidic with less oxygen which harms marine life.\nThomson said the conference probably represents the best opportunity ever "to reverse the cycle of decline that human activity has brought upon the ocean" and spur action to meet the U.N. goal for 2030 to conserve and manage the ocean\'s resources.\nCredit: EDITH M.

Absolutely not!\nHey, believers and deniers, shut your mouths and open your eyes. The earth is getting greener. Yes, it\'s caused by increased CO2, and called the "fertilizer effect." Fossil fuels are responsible (80 percent increase since 1980), and they have kept 7 billion people from starving.\nThe climate prophets are all wrong. Two examples: 1. Arctic ice has not disappeared. What did two Russian icebreakers get stuck in last January? Mud? 2. By 2000, or before, Asia, China and South America were supposed to have severe famines. Today, they are exporting food.\nCheap energy now supplies 86 percent of the world\'s energy with a prosperity unprecedented in human history. We are not running out of it. Every year since 1946, the international petroleum industry has discovered at least five new tons of recoverable oil for every three consumed.\nIf you want a war on coal, extinguish those 6,000 uncontrolled coal seam fires burning worldwide. While you\'re thinking about it, go plant some trees.\n\nDale Ferguson,\n\n\nPolson\n\n'b'Less than a week after thousands of Americans marched on Washington and in hundreds of cities around the country in support of science-based policymaking, the Trump administration quietly removed any mention of climate change from the Environmental Protection Agencys website. One of the pages no longer accessible to the public is the EPAs decades-old climate change information hub - despite the fact that the agencys own science demonstrates that climate change is a real and urgent threat.\nActions like these are shamefully partisan, but the facts of climate change cannot be viewed through a partisan lens. To do so would be detrimental to the collective efforts needed in order to meet and overcome the challenges we face as the earth continues to warm.\nNow more than ever, public outreach is imperative, and public participation - being connected with and involved in policy issues - can make the difference between feeling apathetic about where our country is going, and feeling empowered to fight for a better government; one that works in tandem with the scientific community and the public to find solutions to our most dire problems.\nProviding an activist opportunity for the previously uninvolved or uninterested is what motivated me to organize a March for Science satellite protest at Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park on April 22. The community here is extremely isolated. The nearest grocery store is over 45 minutes away, not counting those pesky bison jams, and so marches in D.C. can feel practically extraterrestrial. But even here in the remote wilderness, shockwaves from the decisions in Washington have shaken us. People are worried. People are frustrated.\nAt the protest itself, we met a variety of individuals concerned about this administrations stance on science and overall "truth." Members of activist groups, such as Environment Montana and the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, were there to lend support, and locals from both inside the park and from towns on the parks exterior came to join in our calls for fact-based environmental policy. A group of students from Concordia College in Minnesota even organized a road trip out to Yellowstone, armed with a passion for truth and their protest signs.\nThe whole process, from conception to organization to execution, was a great learning experience for me. Luckily, I had support in my neighbors Michelle Ciotta and Jenny Jost, the latter of which experienced her first protest ever at our science march. And that was what the whole experience was about. Yes, we provided postcards for the public to write to their elected officials, and our two petitions garnered over 100 signatures, but the secondary goal was to galvanize the previously politically detached. To bring fresh faces and new voices into the resistance.\nAmericans are waking up and taking a stand, some for the first time in their lives. We wont abide alternative facts, the censoring of scientific data or apathy. Turning your back on climate change doesnt make it any less real. As we continue our efforts to reach out and inform, I hope U.S. Sen. Jon Tester will oppose President Trumps efforts to block climate action and this administrations efforts to undermine truth.\n'b'UNITED NATIONS * The 193 U.N. member nations issued Friday an urgent call for action to reverse the decline in the health and productivity of the world\'s oceans  with the United States backing the action plan but rejecting its support for the Paris agreement to tackle climate change.\nMinisters and diplomats burst into applause as the final document was gaveled to approval by consensus at the end of the first-ever U.N. conference on oceans.\nIt recognizes the critical importance of the world\'s seas : Covering three-quarter of the Earth, they supply nearly half the oxygen that we breathe, absorb over a quarter of the carbon dioxide we produce, provide food, and play key roles in water cycles and the climate system.\nThe government leaders called on people and organizations everywhere to take action to reverse the threats from plastic garbage, illegal and excessive fishing, rising sea levels , and increasing acidity of ocean water that is killing marine life.\nThough the call for action was unanimously approved, countries are allowed to express reservations afterward. Egypt and Russia also dissociated their governments from specific provisions, but the United States was the only country to oppose the Paris accord. And when France and the European Union spoke after the U.S. and urged implementation of the climate deal, they received loud applause.\nU.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State David Balton, who is in charge of oceans and fisheries, noted President Donald Trump\'s announcement on June 1 that the United States would withdraw from the Paris agreement or renegotiate U.S. participation, which has already been rejected by other countries.\nBut Balton said the U.S. remained committed to work inside and outside the U.N. to address "threats to the ocean and to promote its conservation and sustainable management for this and future generations."\nGeneral Assembly President Peter Thomson said his goal for the five-day conference was to start the reversal of the decline of the oceans. "I am 100 percent satisfied," he said. "From this point onward nobody can say they are unaware. The bar has been raised on global consciousness and awareness."\nThomson stressed, when asked why there was no serious fighting over the call for action, that the ocean is the common heritage of mankind and that restoring its health is a great challenge of our time.\n"If it\'s dying, it\'s dying on all of us," he said. "When it comes to the ocean there\'s no them and us. It\'s all of us or nothing."\nIn 2015, world leaders adopted new U.N. goals for 2030 including on conserving and managing the ocean\'s resources. Sweden\'s Deputy Prime Minister Isabella Lovin, the conference co-chair, said more than 1,200 commitments were registered by countries, organizations and the private sector  and more were expected.\nCredit: EDITH M.

That\'s still to come.\nStill, the department described its communication as a "strong message" to the world, following Trump\'s decision in June to leave the accord.\n"The State Department is telling that U.N. what the president already told the world on June 1 and it has no legal effect," said Nigel Purvis, who directed U.S. climate diplomacy during the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations.\nPurvis said countries can\'t withdraw from new international agreements, including the Paris climate one, until three years after they go into effect. The Paris agreement went into effect on Nov. 4, 2016.\nThen the process takes a year.\nThe State Department cited the same timeline, saying it can officially start withdrawing as soon as November 2019. That means the earliest the U.S. can be out of the climate agreement is Nov. 4, 2020  the day after the next presidential election.\nIn a statement, the State Department said the U.S. will continue to participate in international meetings and negotiations on current and future climate change deals. The next meeting is in Bonn, Germany, in November.\nTrump is "open to re-engaging in the Paris Agreement if the United States can identify terms that are more favorable to it, its business, its workers, its people and its taxpayers," the department said.\nUnder the agreement, countries set their own national plans for cutting climate emissions. That means Trump can come up with different targets for the United States than those set by President Barack Obama. But Trump can\'t unilaterally change the text of the Paris deal.\nU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric confirmed that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres received "a communication" from U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley "expressing the intention of the United States to exercise its right to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, as soon as it is eligible to do so under the Agreement, unless it identifies suitable terms for reengagement."\n"The secretary-general welcomes any effort to re-engage in the Paris Agreement by the United States," he said.\nDujarric reiterated Guterres\' June 1 statement calling the U.S. decision to withdraw "a major disappointment for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security."\n"It is crucial that the United States remains a leader on climate and sustainable development," Dujarric said. \nUnder Obama, the U.S. agreed to reduce polluting emissions more than a quarter from 2005 levels by the year 2025. There is no climate court. All that\'s required in the agreement is a plan and reporting on progress toward reaching self-set goals.\nNo matter what the U.S. does, the Paris agreement remains in effect because enough other countries ratified it.\nThe Paris pact aims to prevent the Earth from heating up by 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit since the start of the industrial age.\nThe world has already warmed about 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the Industrial Revolution. The overwhelming majority of scientists say the burning of coal, oil and gas is causing the Earth\'s climate to change because of heat-trapping gases.\nCredit: SETH BORENSTEIN; Associated Press\nCaption: FILE - In this Thursday, June 1, 2017 file photo, President Donald Trump speaks about the U.S. role in the Paris climate change accord in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington.

But fears had loomed large beforehand that the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who rejects the Paris agreement, would seek to block any advances seen as counter to American interests.\nIn the end, most agreed that U.S. diplomats had engaged constructively, while delegations from several American states, cities and businesses were praised for committing themselves to the goals of the Paris agreement.\nThe role of spoiler almost fell to Saudi Arabia, which held up a final agreement for several hours over objections to a phrase it feared might allow for future levies on fossil fuels including oil.\n"There has been positive momentum all around us," said Fiji\'s Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, who presided over the meeting .\n"We leave Bonn having notched up some notable achievements," Bainimarama said, citing agreements on agriculture, ocean protection, indigenous people\'s rights and the launch of a new system to help people in poor countries get insurance against the effects of climate change.\nMany countries are already feeling the heat that is enveloping the globe, with dramatic floods, hurricanes and droughts across the world in recent months adding a sense of urgency to the talks.\nEnvironmental groups expressed satisfaction , while noting there\'s much still to do and little time left to ensure the Paris accord\'s goal of keeping global warming significantly below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) is met.\nExperts say worldwide average temperatures have already risen 1 degree Celsius since pre-industrial times, largely due to carbon emissions from the United States and Europe over the past century.\n"The conference gets a grade of \'meets expectations,\'" said Andrew Deutz of the Nature Conservancy, an Arlington-based environmental group. "We are still headed in the right direction, but since the U.S. took its foot off the accelerator, the risk of global climate action slowing down has increased."\nU.S. diplomat Judith Garber, speaking at the talks Thursday, reiterated Trump\'s position that the United States will leave the Paris accord but added that "we remain open to the possibility of rejoining at a later date under terms more favorable to the American people." Garber, the acting assistant secretary of state for oceans and international environmental and scientific affairs, said Washington remains "committed to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions through, among other things, increased innovation on sustainable energy and energy efficiency, and working toward low greenhouse gas emissions energy systems."\nThe conciliatory tone coming from U.S. diplomats was at odds with the more combative position taken by White House adviser George David Banks, who raised eyebrows by hosting a pro-coal event during the talks.\n"Having already abandoned its leadership role on climate, the Trump administration appears to be living in an alternate universe with its focus on fossil fuels," said Paula Caballero, who heads the climate program of the Washington-based World Resources Institute.\nCaballero noted that the leaders of U.S. states, cities and businesses  who came to Bonn separately from the White House and State Department delegations  earned widespread approval for pledging to honor the Paris accord.\nGermany, which hosted the meeting, received mixed reviews. While many praised its negotiators for brokering deals between opposing groups , there was also disappointment that Chancellor Angela Merkel failed to join other rich countries in announcing a firm deadline for phasing out the use of coal-fired power plants.\nMerkel is currently locked in coalition talks with the environmentalist Green party and the pro-business Free Democrats, who disagree about the use of coal.\nThe Bonn meeting was a stepping stone toward next year\'s talks in Katowice, Poland, where key decisions will have to be made, including on finalizing the Paris rulebook and raising countries\' national ambitions for cutting greenhouse gas emissions.\nCredit: By FRANK JORDANS; Associated Press\n'b'WASHINGTON * To small island nations where the land juts just above the rising seas, the U.S. pulling out of the Paris global warming pact makes the future seem as fragile and built on hope as a sand castle.\nTop scientists say it was already likely that Earth\'s temperatures and the world\'s seas will keep rising to a point where some island states may not survive through the next 100 years.\nThat likelihood increases, they say, if the United States doesn\'t follow through on promised cuts in heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions. President Donald Trump this month said he\'d withdraw the United States from the climate deal, prompting leaders of vulnerable islands to talk about their future with a mixture of defiance, hope and resignation.\n"If we really push into action, we can save some (small islands), but we may not be able save all of them," said Hans-Otto Poertner, a German scientist who chairs the climate impacts study group for the United Nations\' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. "The chances are even less with the U.S. pulling out of the climate agreement in Paris."\nWhile calling Trump\'s announcement "deeply disappointing," Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine told The Associated Press: "I cannot give up on my people and my country and my culture. It\'s very important for us to be optimistic."\nHeine and other island leaders are putting their hope in strong pollution curbs by China, other nations, individual American states and cities, as well as improved technology. While visiting Europe, she said: "It\'s all the more important that Europe takes the lead on climate change."\nPalau\'s environment minister F. Umiich Sengebau said he has no choice but to cling to hope.\n"Right now some of the islands have disappeared," he said. "And so if we continue this trend our very existence as small islands could very well disappear in many instances."\nThe U.S. State Department said it considers engagement with other counties on climate change important and it will continue, including with small island states. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said after Trump pulled out of the agreement that the U.S. had cut its carbon dioxide emissions "dramatically" even before the Paris pact was reached.\nWhen the Paris pact was being negotiated in 2015, small island nations successfully campaigned for a stricter but secondary target for limiting global heat-trapping emissions.\nIn 2009, world leaders adopted a goal to prevent 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since the industrial era started, saying 2 degrees is a dangerous level of warming. The islands\' tougher goal would try to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial time.\nThe world has already warmed about 1 degree Celsius, so the islands are really trying to prevent another half-degree of warming Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit).\nWhen Trump announced he would pull the U.S. out of the Paris treaty, scientists said that made the 2-degree goal close to unachievable and the 1.5-degree goal even more out of reach. Promised American pollution cuts were about one-fifth of the pledged global reductions hoped for in the accord. And even if all the pact\'s pledges were fully realized, it wouldn\'t stop warming from hitting 2 degrees without even stricter actions in the future, according to computer simulations.\n"We are pushing the 1.5 (as a goal), but realistically I think we have passed the point that it can be achieved," said Kenrick Leslie, executive director of the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre . Trump\'s Paris pull-out, he said, has "thrown it right out the window."\nSmall islands "are the most vulnerable parts of the world," said scientist Jim Skea of the Imperial College in London, who chairs another U.N. climate panel. Exceeding 1.5 degrees "really makes the vulnerability threat for them more acute. It\'s kind of existential."\nScientists and carbon emissions computer modelers at Climate Analytics helped the small islands in their campaign called "1.5 to stay alive," and they say it is still possible, though unlikely, to limit the warming to that much.\nThat scenario involves overshooting the 1.5 degree goal and then eventually allowing no new carbon dioxide emissions into the air. But even that isn\'t enough so the world would have to somehow pull huge amounts of carbon dioxide out of the air, which is technically feasible but not practical at the moment, said Climate Analytics scientific adviser Carl-Friedrich Schleussner.\nRecent studies have shown that the sea level rise in the past decade or so has accelerated compared to previous decades, said University of Colorado sea level expert Steve Nerem. He estimates a meter of sea level rise by the end of this century and emphasizes it could be worse with ice sheet melts in Greenland and Antarctica.\n"Anything over a meter (a yard) is catastrophic for these small islands," Nerem said.\nCredit: SETH BORENSTEIN and NICK PERRY; Associated Press\nCaption: FILE - In this Nov. 5, 2015 file, aerial photo a small uninhabited island that has slipped beneath the water line only showing a small pile of rocks at low tide on Majuro Atoll in the Marshall Islands.

Trump himself kept everyone in suspense, saying he was still listening to "a lot of people both ways."\nThe White House signaled that Trump was likely to decide to leave the global pact  fulfilling one of his principal campaign pledges  though top aides were divided. And the final decision may not be entirely clear-cut: Aides were still deliberating on "caveats in the language," one official said.\nEveryone cautioned that no decision was final until Trump announced it. The president has been known to change his thinking on major decisions and tends to seek counsel from both inside and outside advisers, many with differing agendas, until the last minute.\nAbandoning the pact would isolate the U.S. from a raft of international allies who spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement to fight global warming and pollution by reducing carbon emissions in nearly 200 nations. While traveling abroad last week, Trump was repeatedly pressed by European leaders and the Vatican to stay in the deal. Withdrawing would leave the United States aligned only with Russia among the world\'s industrialized economies.\nAmerican corporate leaders have also appealed to the businessman-turned-president to stay. They include Apple, Google and Wal-Mart. Even fossil fuel companies such as Exxon Mobil, BP and Shell say the United States should abide by the deal.\nThen-President Barack Obama enacted the deal without U.S. Senate ratification. A formal withdrawal would take years, experts say, a situation that led the president of the European Commission to speak dismissively of Trump on Wednesday.\nTrump doesn\'t "comprehensively understand" the terms of the accord, though European leaders tried to explain the process for withdrawing to him "in clear, simple sentences" during summit meetings last week, Jean-Claude Juncker said in Berlin. "It looks like that attempt failed," Juncker said. "This notion, \'I am Trump, I am American, America first and I am getting out,\' that is not going to happen."\nSome of Trump\'s aides have been searching for a middle ground  perhaps by renegotiating the terms of the agreement  in an effort to thread the needle between his base of supporters who oppose the deal and those warning that a U.S. exit would deal a blow to the fight against global warming as well as to worldwide U.S. leadership.\nThat fight has played out within Trump\'s administration.\nTrump met Wednesday with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has favored remaining in the agreement. Chief strategist Steve Bannon supports an exit, as does Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt.\nTrump\'s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, has discussed the possibility of changing the U.S. carbon reduction targets instead of pulling out of the deal completely. Senior adviser Jared Kushner generally thinks the deal is bad but still would like to see if emissions targets can be changed.\nTrump\'s influential daughter Ivanka Trump\'s preference is to stay, but she has made it a priority to establish a review process so her father would hear from all sides, a senior administration official said. Like the other officials, that person was not authorized to describe the private discussions by name and spoke only on condition of anonymity.\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke said Wednesday in Alaska that he had "yet to read what the actual Paris Agreement is" and would have to read it before weighing in.\nTrump has several options, climate experts said.\nThe emissions goals are voluntary with no real consequences for countries that fail to meet them. That means the U.S. could stay in the accord and choose not to hit its goals or stay in the pact but adjust its targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. has agreed to reduce its emissions by 2025 to 26 percent to 28 percent of 2005 levels  about 1.6 billion tons.\n"Paris more than anything is a symbol," said Nigel Purvis, who directed U.S. climate diplomacy during the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.\nAnother option, said University of California, Berkeley climate scientist Zeke Hausfather, would be for Trump to withdraw from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the treaty on which the Paris accord was based, which would take only a year.\nNews of Trump\'s expected decision drew swift reaction from the United Nations. The organization\'s main Twitter page quoted Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as saying, "Climate change is undeniable. Climate change is unstoppable. Climate solutions provide opportunities that are unmatchable."\nScientists say that Earth is likely to reach more dangerous levels of warming sooner if the U.S. retreats from its pledge because America contributes so much to rising temperatures. Calculations suggest withdrawal could result in emissions of up to 3 billion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the air a year  enough to melt ice sheets more quickly, raise seas higher and trigger more extreme weather.\nThe Sierra Club\'s executive director, Michael Brune, called the expected move a "historic mistake which our grandchildren will look back on with stunned dismay at how a world leader could be so divorced from reality and morality."\nTrump claimed before taking office that climate change was a "hoax" created by the Chinese to hurt the U.S. economy, an assertion that stands in defiance of broad scientific consensus. He has spent his first months in office working to delay and roll back federal regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions while pledging to revive long-struggling U.S. coal mines.\nBut Cohn, Trump\'s chief White House economic adviser, told reporters during the trip abroad that the president\'s views on climate change were "evolving" after the discussions with European leaders.\nStill, Cohn said that the carbon levels agreed to by the prior administration "would be highly crippling to the U.S. economic growth" and that if the president had to choose between limiting carbon and economic growth, "growing our economy is going to win."\n\'POWERFUL MESSAGE\' FOR EXXON\nExxon Mobil Corp.\'s chief executive said Wednesday that the company would reconsider how it communicates the risks its faces from climate change after shareholders approved a measure calling for increased transparency.\nThe nonbinding proposal passed with 62 percent of ballots cast in a rare defeat for Exxon\'s management, which had recommended a vote against the measure. The company argued that it already provides sufficient information on the potential impact of changing technologies and energy demand on its asset portfolio.\nAsset manager BlackRock Inc. backed the proposal, according to a source familiar with the matter. BlackRock holds about 6 percent of Exxon shares.\n"It\'s a powerful message," New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said in an interview. \nThe proposal asked for Exxon to report on risks its business could face from technology changes and from climate change policies such as the 2015 Paris accord.\nCredit: JILL COLVIN and JULIE PACE; Associated Press; Reuters contributed to this report.\nCaption: President Donald Trump awaits the arrival of Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc to the White House in Washington, Wednesday, May 31, 2017.

Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., issued the following news release:\nToday, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (R-NY-21), Congressman Carlos Curbelo (FL-26), and Congressman Ryan Costello (PA06) led a group of House Republican colleagues in introducing a resolution that calls for using American innovation to improve environmental stewardship.\nThe lawmakers were joined by fourteen other Members of Congress: Reps. Mark Amodei (NV-02), Don Bacon (NE-02), Barbara Comstock (VA-10), John Faso (NY-19), Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-08), John Katko (NY-24), Mia Love (UT-04), Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (FL-27), Frank LoBiondo (NJ-02), Brian Mast (FL-18), Pat Meehan (PA-07), Tom Reed (NY-23), David Reichert (WA-08), and Mark Sanford (SC-01).\nThe resolution introduced today calls on the House of Representatives to commit to working on economically viable solutions that address the risks of climate change, calling on "American ingenuity, innovation, and exceptionalism, " and citing the "conservative principle to protect, conserve, and be good stewards of our environment."\n"I am pleased to introduce this resolution with so many of my Republican colleagues and I thank them for their support on this effort," said Congresswoman Stefanik (NY-21). "Clean energy innovation is key to addressing the serious issue of climate change. This resolution brings together the priority of addressing the risks of climate change with the importance of protecting and creating American jobs. Innovation and clean energy are key to solving both. New York\'s 21st district is the proud home of the Adirondacks and we understand that protecting our environment plays an important role in promoting economic growth and opportunity."\n"With forty percent of Florida\'s population at risk from sea-level rise, my state is on the front lines of climate change," said Congressman Carlos Curbelo (FL-26), co-chair of the Climate Solutions Caucus. "South Florida residents are already beginning to feel the effects of climate change in their daily lives - from chronic flooding to coral bleaching to threats to our freshwater supply in the Everglades.  We cannot ignore these challenges and every Member of Congress has a responsibility to our constituents and future generations to support market-based solutions, investments, and innovations that could alleviate the effects of climate change and make our nation more resilient. Our goal with this resolution is to shift the debate from whether climate change is real toward the tangible efforts to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate its effects."\n"The preservation of the environment and our natural resources for future generations should be a priority for us all," said Congressman Ryan Costello (PA-06), a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. "We should leverage conservative principles to develop innovative, economically viable ways to achieve this goal, including through clean energy technologies. I hope to see the Republican Climate Resolution gain momentum and be part of the solutions we advance this Congress."\nThe resolution calls for better environmental stewardship through "economically viable, and broadly supported private and public solutions to study and address the causes and effects of measured changes to our global and regional climates."\nThe text of the resolution can be found here (https://stefanik.house.gov/sites/stefanik.house.gov/files/Climate%20Change%20Resolution.pdf).\nWhat They\'re Saying:\nMark Reynolds, Executive Director, Citizens\' Climate Lobby\n"The risks of climate change are far too great to get bogged down in partisan politics. With this resolution, these 17 Republicans are saying that business-as-usual is unacceptable when it comes to preserving a livable world for future generations. Hopefully, their leadership will help us turn the page and move forward on solutions to this critical problem."\nDiane Randall, Executive Secretary, Friends Committee on National Legislation (The Quaker lobby in the public interest)\n"The leadership demonstrated by the 17 co-sponsors of this Republican climate resolution is such a hopeful step forward. This resolution shows that our moral obligation to address climate change and protect vulnerable communities transcends partisanship, and that there truly is political will to address this issue from both political parties in Congress. Now, more than ever, we pray that Congress will quickly pivot the dialogue towards meaningful climate solutions."\nDavid Jenkins, President, Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship\n"The significance of this Republican climate resolution cannot be overstated. Real conservatives don\'t deny reality, they face it. They don\'t avoid problems, they tackle them head on. The resolution\'s 17 initial cosponsors are stepping up on an issue that grows more urgent every day, and showing the prudent, fact-based--and yes, conservative--leadership our nation needs. We are grateful for this important first step."\nDan Misleh, Executive Director, Catholic Climate Covenant\n"The Catholic Climate Covenant applauds the moral courage of the 17 Republican legislators who have introduced this resolution. The Catholic Church recognizes the threat that climate change poses to our common home and to human life and dignity - especially of the poor and vulnerable, and of those in future generations. We are heartened that Congress is responding to Pope Francis\'s call in his address to Congress and in Laudato Si to "enter into dialogue with all people about our common home" (Laudato Si\', no. 3). We encourage House members take the next step of joining the bipartisan House Climate Solutions Caucus."\nThe Niskanen Center\n"The sponsors of the Republican Climate Resolution understand that there is nothing conservative about ignoring the enormous risks of climate change. As conservatives, we believe the government exists to protect property rights and lives. It is clear that climate change will put both at risk for our kids and future generations. It is also clear that we have the means to significantly reduce those risks and leave a prosperous and clean future for posterity. The Niskanen Center applauds these Republicans who are looking to take positive steps forward finding practical and market-based solutions for climate change."\nKen Kimmell, President, Union of Concerned Scientists\n"I\'m heartened to see Republican House members introduce a resolution committing Congress to address climate change and base its policy decisions on science and quantifiable facts. While the resolution doesn\'t explicitly make the link to fossil fuel emissions, it shows that these Republican lawmakers are not in a state of denial about this key issue. The U.S. is seeing more extreme weather due to climate change, including flooding, droughts and wildfires, which cost taxpayers billions of dollars in damages. There\'s strength in numbers, and I hope that this sizable group of responsible leaders will have an impact on votes in Congress."\nFrancesco "Frank" Femia and Caitlin Werrell, Co-Founders and Presidents, The Center for Climate and Security\n"This resolution demonstrates that the security risks of climate change are a reality that partisanship cannot continue to obscure. The Department of Defense and intelligence community have recognized this issue across both Republican and Democratic Administrations, and it\'s heartening to see Republican policy-makers from all parts of the country acting on that."\nMindy Lubber, President, Ceres (A nonprofit mobilizing business and investor leadership for a sustainable global economy)\n"Today\'s announcement sends a loud and clear message that addressing climate change need not be a partisan issue. We applaud all lawmakers - no matter their party affiliation - who recognize the urgency of tackling climate change and the enormous economic opportunities of accelerating clean energy in all parts of the United States. The cosponsors of this resolution have shown bold leadership, and we look forward to working with them to craft bipartisan climate solutions that Americans want and expect from Washington."\nLynn Scarlett, Managing Director of Public Policy, The Nature Conservancy\n"As a science-driven organization, The Nature Conservancy strongly supports actions to address climate change. We appreciate the leadership of Reps. Stefanik, Curbelo, and Costello and their fellow members of Congress in recognizing the consequences of a changing climate and calling for solutions to this challenge."\nThe Rev. Mitch Hescox, President/CEO, The Evangelical Environmental Network (EEN)\n"We are proud of the courageous leadership of Rep. Elise Stefanik (NY-21), Rep. Carlos Curbelo (FL-26), Rep. Ryan Costello (PA-6), and the 14 other Republican co-sponsors of this House Resolution affirming that climate change is a serious problem that must be addressed in order for us to be "good stewards of our environment ...".  We heartily concur and stand ready to support efforts to do so".\nHeather Reams, Managing Director, Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions\n"Addressing climate change through clean energy solutions is smart policy and smart politics. Time and again, CRES polling shows that voters overwhelming support lawmakers who prioritize clean energy to advance the economy, create good paying jobs, promote energy independence, and protect the environment."\nAdmiral Frank "Skip" Bowman, U.S. Navy (ret), Member of the Advisory Board, The Center for Climate and Security, Former Director of the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program: "I support this Republican Climate Resolution.  Putting aside arguments of cause and effect, there are measured and measurable data and global events that must be considered and accounted for in our defense planning."\nRear Admiral David W. Titley, U.S. Navy (ret), Member of the Advisory Board, The Center for Climate and Security, Former Oceanographer of the Navy: "I\'m very excited to see the Republican Climate Change Resolution introduced to the Congress.  Our nation\'s long-term security is critically dependent on moving away from fossil-based fuels to lessen the worst risks of climate change.  This change will not happen without support and leadership from the Congress, in partnership with the Administration. The Republican Climate Change Resolution is a good first step towards a serious bi-partisan policy discussion."\nCommander David "Deke" Slayton, U.S. Navy (ret), Member of the Advisory Board, The Center for Climate and Security: "The Republican Climate Resolution ably and well serves as an imperative and call for action for our Nation. The resolution captures the issues of an observable, changing climate and the dynamic events we see unfolding in the worlds oceans today. These critical events demand U.S. Congressional and national executive leadership, now. "\nSherri Goodman, Member of the Advisory Board, The Center for Climate and Security, Former Deputy Undersecretary of Defense: "The Republican Climate Resolution, whose signers represent a broad cross-section of America affected by climate change, from our coasts to rural agricultural areas, soundly recognizes that climate change is a "threat multiplier" that will adversely affect our national security interests as well as all Americans, where we live and work.  The leaders of this effort should be commended for recognizing that we need both to study and address changes in our global and regional climates, and build more resilient communities for America\'s future."\nVice Admiral Lee Gunn, U.S. Navy (ret): "I am enthusiastically adding my support for this Republican Climate Resolution (Ms. Stefanik, et al., \'Expressing the commitment of the House of Representatives to conservative environmental stewardship.\'). The resolution acknowledges, among other things, the enormous national security importance of stewardship of the environment for America. Our armed services depend on predictable conditions at home for training, maintenance, drills and exercises, and bases, all components of building ready military forces. Also, the demands worldwide on not only our military but our economic, diplomatic and political power, demands on all elements of our national power, will inevitably be greater if the environment becomes less predictable. The Republican Climate Resolution supports not only traditional American values, but the practical imperative of maintaining our security at home and abroad."\nColonel Lawrence Wilkerson, U.S. Army (ret), former chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell, Visiting Professor of Government and Public Policy, the College of William and Mary: "The Republican Climate Change Resolution being introduced in the Congress--the Gibson Resolution under new leadership--symbolizes my political party\'s recognition of climate change\'s impact on national security, an impact already being felt from the shipyards at Hampton Roads to the Ship Channel in Houston, Texas.  Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and her 16 Republican co-sponsors are to be congratulated for their herculean efforts to bring my political party to a firm recognition of these risks."\n07M-Vitin-5805405 07M-Vitin\n'b' The New York Times\' recent decision to hire Wall Street Journal columnist Bret Stephens has incited backlash from climate change scientists due to Stephens\' record of denying the existence of climate change. \n\nOn April 22, the Times\' Public Editor Liz Spayd defended the hire in an article relegating climate change scientists who have voiced concern over Stephens as "left-leaning" and claimed they "rummaged" through his old articles to confirm their biases against him. Spayd also mocked threats of subscription cancellations, saying she was told that not many followed through. \n\nDr. Michael Mann--a leading climate change scientist featured in Leonardo DiCaprio\'s climate change documentary Before the Flood who also testified before Congress on the issue earlier this year and appeared alongside Bill Nye during the recent March for Science--canceled his Times subscription in a boycott against Stephens and Spayd\'s defense of him. "The @NYTimes hiring of climate denier didn\'t lead me to cancel subscription. Public editor\'s offensive response did," Dr. Mann tweeted on April 25. Several other scientists and environmentalists supported his decision. \n\n"Apparently public editor doesn\'t know the difference between different opinions & absolute nonsense," tweeted Robert Brulle, professor of Environmental Science at Drexel University. Former Director of GreenPeace Kelly Rigg tweeted, "@nytimes probably think they\'re being brave in defending their decision, as opposed to just plain stupid." \n\nRather than acknowledging the reality of climate change and trying to rectify hiring someone who refutes that reality, the Times\' public editor reduced climate change to "liberal orthodoxy," further politicizing what nearly every scientist in the world has affirmed is irrefutable scientific fact. \n\nBret Stephens isn\'t merely a skeptic of climate change. In 2015, he called climate change an "imaginary enemy" of modern liberalism. In the same article, he reduced institutional racism and the campus rape epidemic as imaginary enemies as well. He concluded the article by stating, "Here\'s a climate prediction for the year 2115: Liberals will still be organizing campaigns against yet another mooted social or environmental crisis. Temperatures will be about the same." \n\nThe op-ed presents dangerous worldview. Recently, Hawaii\'s Mauna Loa Observatory recorded that there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere--410 parts per million--than anytime in the past 50 million years. Climate models have been accurately predicting ocean and global warming. NASA has noted that 16 of the 17 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001. Extreme weather events have increased. The ocean is becoming increasingly acidic. Snow cover and polar ice caps have gradually disappeared. \n\nThe evidence of human induced climate change is indisputable, and the New York Times has abandoned its newly adopted marketing campaign "The Truth" by hiring a columnist who has an aversion to the facts on one of the world\'s most important issues. \n\nCredit: Michael Sainato \n'b"An important international meeting about climate change took place in Bonn, Germany earlier this month. Attended by more than 10,000 delegates, it received relatively little attention in the world's press - with some exceptions - but it laid down an important marker in global politics. Climate change shows every sign of becoming the defining issue of our time. So what are the key updates? \nYet another climate meeting - what was it all about? Bonn was the 23rd UN Conference of the Parties (COP23), an annual international meeting to agree plans to address climate change. Two years ago, the Paris meeting made history by establishing an agreement to prevent global warming of more than two degrees by the end of the century - and 1.5 degrees if at all possible. Bonn represents the next phase of the project. \nIn what way? The purpose of the Bonn meeting was to draw up rules and guidelines to implement the Paris Agreement, due to come into force in 2020. This amounted to each nation agreeing to a roadmap to achieve necessary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions across different sectors such as agriculture and transport. \nYet the US   is pulling out of the Paris Agreement? Yes, US president Donald Trump has declared he will remove the US from the Paris accord. It's disappointing, but no great surprise. For many years now, most Republican senators have refused to accept the scientific verdict of a link between greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Since Trump's election, we have seen the appointment of fossil fuel advocates and climate sceptics to almost all key US governmental positions concerned with the environment, so the withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement was predictable. In fact, the official US delegation at Bonn hosted a meeting extolling the virtues of coal. \nWon't the loss of the US   scupper the Paris   Agreement? Ironically, the White House stance seems to have concentrated political opinion. Another urgent prompt is we are beginning to experience the first effects of climate change manifest as an increased frequency of severe storms, heat waves and flooding. Now that the general public is beginning to take the issue more seriously, politicians will follow. \nAnd the media? It's curious climate change shows every sign of becoming the defining issue of the 21st century, yet media coverage of the issue remains sporadic. Worse, large sections of the tabloid press have been peddling climate scepticism for years. However, the public mood is changing and will change further as global warming manifests itself. \nWhat about Ireland? There's no denying Ireland's emissions are increasing in major sectors such as transport and agriculture. Indeed, we are ranked lowest of all European countries in terms of our action on climate change. \nAren't we bound by EU targets? We are, but we will probably miss our 2020 targets and face a hefty fine. You can expect this to be portrayed as bureaucrats imposing unreasonable targets. \nWe're hardly the only ones?  That's true, but not much of a consolation. The latest studies suggest even if each country meets its commitments under the Paris Agreement, our planet will likely warm by more than two degrees by the end of the century, the limit beyond which impacts of climate change are expected to become very severe. \nHow trustworthy is that forecast?  There is no doubt the earth's climate is sensitive to certain greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and no doubt an increase in the concentration of such gases is beginning to have an effect. If the phenomenon continues unchecked, we can expect a continuing rise in surface temperatures and sea levels, resulting in increased drought in many parts of Africa and increased flooding in many parts of Asia, to mention just two outcomes. We can also expect a rise in political instability in climate-vulnerable regions, accompanied by a global refugee problem, so it's not a problem we can ignore. \nDr Cormac O'Raifeartaigh lectures in physics at Waterford Institute of Technology and is a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society\nCredit: Kevin O'Sullivan\n"b'From Houston all the way to Mumbai and from Nepal to the desert state of Rajasthan, rains have cut a swathe of destruction with flooded streets and thousands marooned as their cities and villages go under.\nWith people across the globe dealing with the humanitarian and economic fallout of unusually heavy rains this year, are extreme weather events the new normal?\nScientists, meteorologists and climate change experts blame rising global temperatures for the erratic weather patterns, leading to instances like heavy rains and floods.\nHeavy rainfall, cloudbursts, thunderstorms and heat waves are indeed becoming the new normal, said former India Meteorological Department (IMD) director general Laxman Singh Rathore.\nA worrying trend, added the consultant with the World Bank for South Asia on Climate Change, was that periodicity and severity had increased.\nIn case of rainfall, the average precipitation has more or less remained the same, the dry spells have increased but the amount of rainfall remains the same. This means there is heavy concentration of rainfall over a particular region while other areas go dry, explained Jatin Singh, CEO of Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency.\nIMD recorded 2016 as the hottest year since 1901. And, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fifth assessment report on climate change, observations since 1950 show changes in some extreme events, particularly daily temperature extremes and heat waves.\nThe IPCC report also noted that it is likely that the frequency of heavy precipitation will increase in the 21st century over many regions.\nAlarming numbers\nAccording to the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), 41 million people have been affected due to torrential rains in India, Nepal and Bangladesh this year. Nearly 900 people have died in the three countries, a report on the UN news website said.\nAn IMD report added that 1,600 people in India died due to extreme heatwave conditions which 475 lives were lost in floods and thunderstorms in 2016.\nRathore said that South Asian countries have been affected due to torrential rains and floods because of high population density.\nBut how does global warming lead to heavy rainfall?\nRoxy Mathew Koll, a scientist researching climate change with the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, a premium institute under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, explained that the atmosphere and the oceans were getting warmer due to increasing carbon dioxide as a result of human activities.\nA warmer atmosphere holds more moisture. This results in two factors. The first is that warm moist air is lighter than cold dry air and hence makes the atmosphere unstable as it rises up, said Koll. The second factor, he added, is that since the atmosphere holds more moisture, it dumps it all together-a heavy rainfall event.\nThese factors leads to erratic weather, including extreme rainfall events across the globe.\nThere are domestic factors, too, that aggravate losses in times of extreme weather. Former IMD DG Rathore pointed out that in case of cities, natural drainage systems have been altered at the cost of infrastructure development.\nOne major reason for the 2005 Mumbai deluge, in which more than 500 people were killed with 944 mm of rain in a single day, was the damage done to natural drainage systems like the Mithi river. The river, which runs through the suburbs, has been revived to some extent now.\nVineet Kumar, Programme Officer (Climate Change) with the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said that research on climate change and its effects was insufficient for exigency plans at the micro-level.\nDue to this, there is a huge gap in planning a policy to deal with the problems occurring due to climate change. For instance, there are not enough studies on the adverse impact on crops due to this phenomenon to come up with a policy on how to deal with it, Kumar said.\nAs states like Bihar count their dead-an estimated 500 killed in the floods this year alone-and Mumbai gets back on its feet after the heavy rains yesterday, the hope is that next year will be different.\nCredit: PTI\n'b'DUBAI, 30th January 2017 (WAM) - The UAE is working on developing a comprehensive strategy to tackle climate and environmental changes, with the aim of protecting natural resources, and reduce negative impact on various economic sectors through developing a sustainable infrastructure based on clean energy, according to Dr. Thani Al Zeyoudi, Minister of Climate Change and Environment.\nDr. Al Zeyoudi said that the UAE will mark National Environment Day under the theme "sustainably in production and consumption" on February 4, adding that the food bank initiative launched by Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is a major step in rationalizing food consumption and reduce food waste, adding that food waste in the GCC region is one of the highest in the world at 60-70% compared to an average of 30% worldwide.\nDr. Al Zeyoudi was speaking at \'Meet the CEO\' event organised by the Government of Dubai Media Office (GDMO). The event was attended by Director General of the Government of Dubai Media Office Mona Ghanem Al Marri and representatives of a number of local, regional and international media.\nThe Minister said that UAE has the capability to successfully address the climate changes and preserve the environment, adding that the Ministry\'s job is to address the most pressing issue of our generation in a way that makes economic sense, and to protect the most important components of our cultural heritage. To achieve this, the ministry has laid the groundwork for comprehensive and ambitious action on climate change and the environment this region has ever witnessed.\nDr. Al Zeyoudi also referred to the UAE\'s experience in adopting the notion of green economy, where he referred to the clean energy projects and initiatives currently being executed by Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar) and Dubai Water and Electricity Authority (DEWA), that helped in increasing the contribution of clean energy to the total energy mix.\nHe also said that by 2021, 4 nuclear power plants will start operation, which will cover huge part of the UAE\'s energy needs. Speaking about preserving water resources, Dr. Thani said that the UAE has 141 dams, adding that the government is currently developing 96 dams, and issued legislations that aim to reduce water resources depletion.\nAt the heart of this will be the UAE National Climate Change Plan, Dr. Al Zeyoudi said. He also said that the UAE already has an impressive track record of having strong partnerships among public and private sector players to position industry and the overall economy for growth and less carbon emissions.\nHe also said that the UAE led the region in deploying clean energy, with pioneering projects and policies in renewable and nuclear energy, energy and water efficiency and carbon sequestration. We have deployed energy-saving infrastructure, from green buildings to world-class public transportation systems.\nDr. Al Zeyoudi also said that The UAE National Climate Plan will build on these important initiatives and further the conviction that climate action can go hand in hand with continued economic growth. The Plan, being developed in close consultation with public and private sectors, is poised to advance the UAE\'s ambitious agenda of diversifying its economy into new, knowledge-based industries. He also said that the priority now is to reduce emissions, while creating more jobs, more growth, and higher levels of awareness.\nGlobally, Dr. Al Zeyoudi said that the ministry is working harder than ever to develop meaningful and result-oriented solutions. He also said that the UAE was the first country in the region to formally join the Paris Agreement: the world\'s first truly global and durable response to climate change. The premise of the Paris Agreement is that each country can determine its own responses to climate change, in accordance with its own economic and development priorities.\nFor the UAE, this means finding solutions that bring together government and the wider public to create new economic and social opportunities.\n Copyright 2016 Emirates News Agency (WAM) Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. (Syndigate.info).\n'b'With electric power going out in those parts of Florida and Texas where powerful hurricanes have made landfall, now would be a good time to assess the long-term viability of America\'s energy grid. If you are someone who has grown accustomed to reliable and affordable energy sources, and are now suddenly without power, try to imagine what that might be like on a regular basis.\nAlthough global warming alarmists have predictably made every effort to link Hurricanes Harvey and Irma with higher greenhouse gas levels, the real threat to American energy comes not from global warming, but from misguided global warming policies.\nThat much is made evident in a highly detailed report the U.S. Department of Energy has just released on "electricity markets and reliability" that should be instructive to federal and state policymakers. One key finding that stands out is the impact government regulations, mandates and subsidies have on current and future energy needs. As variable renewable energy has gained traction within the energy grid, it has become more difficult and challenging to meet growing energy needs, according to the report.\nThat\'s because wind and solar energy sources cannot stand on their own two feet without government intervention. Unlike their fossil counterparts, renewable energy sources are intermittent, unreliable, and expensive. But they did gain political favor during the Obama administration as a way to mitigate the potential effects of man-made global warming. Since a growing number of scientists now identify natural influences, as opposed to human emissions, as the primary drivers of climate change, it\'s time to let solar and wind energy rise and fall on their own merits. The government subsidies and mandates that prop up renewable energy have contributed to the "premature retirement of baseload power plants," the study says. The lesson here is that what is politically fashionable and trendy does not always make sense economically or scientifically.\nSo, is there room for renewable energy to operate effectively in the absence of government intervention?\nThe Institute for Energy Research has released its own report titled "The Solar Value Cliff" that addresses this very question and concludes that at "low penetration levels" solar power can alleviate stress on the electricity grid. However, IER also finds that solar energy "contributes no additional capacity to the grid at a penetration level of 6 percent or beyond. Indeed, additional solar above the threshold is actively harmful to the ability of operators to maintain the capacity of the grid because it undermines the economics of those energy sources that must continue to provide the capacity to meet peak demand."\nPut simply, solar could have a constructive, but limited role as part of a mixed approach to energy unfettered from government directives.\nIdeally, it would be best not to politicize the human tragedies that flow out of natural disasters like Harvey and Irma. Contrary to what has been reported by some media outlets, the extreme weather conditions that have occurred recently are not out of proportion what has happened historically. In fact, in the past 140 years, major landfall hurricanes have actually declined even as CO2 has risen.\nThe population centers that are most vulnerable to severe weather are the ones that stand to lose the most if unworkable, inefficient energy displaces fossil fuels that have raised living standards across the globe. In fact, there\'s an argument to be made that the oil and gas industry has saved lives that would have otherwise perished in the recent hurricanes.\nThere will always be challenges to humanity in the form of extreme weather, but we\'ll be better positioned to handle natural disasters in the future if policymakers embrace technological innovation and responsible industrial development rather than unfounded global warming hysteria.\nKevin Mooney (@KevinMooneyDC) is a contributor to the Washington Examiner\'s Beltway Confidential blog. He is an investigative reporter in Washington, D.C. who writes for several national publications.\n'b'The eighth edition of Petersberg Climate dialogue began here with serious concerns over United States withdrawing from an active role in climate change leadership.\nGerman minister for environment, nature conservation and nuclear safety Barbara Hendricks said the process to persuade the US administration under President Donald Trump to continue with the policies of the previous Obama regime had begun at various levels.\nSpeaking to reporters before the inaugural session of the two-day informal ministerial-level dialogue, Hendricks said: "We are trying to influence the United States through different people and channels. Foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel has met with US secretary of state Rex Tillerson. The German chancellor has spoken repeatedly with President Trump over phone."\nUS, which has the highest emissions per year after China, is ex pected to make its position clear on the role it would play in the internationally in the two-day G7 summit beginning on Friday in Sicily .\nLater in her inaugural address, Hendricks underlined the need for the international community to stay united on the climate change course decided in the Paris Agreement. "It is fundamentally important that the global community remains united now...  We need to flesh out the effective framework for nation states and now the ball is again in the court of governments," she said.\nThe inaugural session began with a moment\'s silence for India\'s environment minister Anil Madhav Dave. Reading out Dave\'s quote, Hendricks said, "Our dear colleague wrote \'If you want to cherish my memory plant trees and save them. That would give me happiness\'. Maybe we can achieve this through our work."\nThe Petersberg Dialogue is an annual informal ministerial consultation which is co-hosted by the German government and the chair of the annual UN-sponsored climate negotiations. The effort was initiated in 2010 by German chancellor Angela Merkel following the failure to secure a global agreement on climate change at Copenhagen in 2009.\nClimate change policy experts, however, are finding a silver lining in the new developments.Lutz Weischer, who heads international climate policy at German Watch, is optimistic about international cooperation on climate  change at this time.\n"We have a president (US president Donald Trump) who we do not know would stay in the Paris agreement. But that has further disciplined other countries who have come together to fight climate change. Internationally we have more unity," Weischer said.\nHe added all eyes are on the twoday summit beginning on Friday."For G7 the unity is very important. But all of them agree that there has to be some language on climate change. Canada has the presidency next year. It has made it clear that G7 unity is very important for it. Japan has never been very ambitious about an aggressive climate language. It has always been where US is," he said.\nThe two-day ministerial level talks would see the unveiling of another forum by European Union, Canada and China that would serve as an alternative to the US state department-sponsored Major Economies Forum.\n(Nidhi Sharma is in Berlin on the invitation of the German government)\n'b'Regarding Roger Pielke Jr.\'s "A Litigious Climate Threatens Scientific Norms\n " (op-ed, Nov. 16): As a meteorologist specializing in numerical weather prediction (the computer models that make your daily weather forecasts), I, too, have "worked alongside climate researchers" since the 1990s.\nWhereas Mr. Pielke finds climate scientists, in his excellent commentary on the dangers of taking scientific disagreements to the courts, "not particularly political," my observation is that many are very political and of these nearly all are left to hard-left of center.\nClimate doesn\'t exist in the same way as weather. It is an abstraction subject to no specific physical law, and as a human idea climate can and is readily politicized to the point of becoming a matter of faith or belief.\nIf rain runoff can be taxed in Maryland, is it any wonder that the science of climate change wouldn\'t be litigated in the judiciary?\nMike Fiorino, Ph.D.\nBoulder, Colo.\n'b'Lobbying groups for the oil industry sought to withdraw from a lawsuit in Oregon challenging the federal government\'s environmental policies, a surprise move that came on the same day they were due to file a court document revealing their position on the science of climate change.\nThe motions filed late Thursday by the American Petroleum Institute and the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers came days after a third trade association, the National Association of Manufacturers, asked a federal judge in Oregon for permission to exit from the 2015 lawsuit.\nThe groups said they were confident the Trump administration could defend their interests in the lawsuit, which alleges the federal government\'s failure to address risks caused by continued fossil fuel use and increased carbon dioxide emissions violated the constitutional rights to "life, liberty, and property."\nLawyers for the environmental group that brought the case accused the trade associations of evading a May 25 deadline that would have required them to make admissions about the science of climate change.\nThe three groups weren\'t originally named as defendants in the lawsuit. They asked to intervene in the case in defense of their members\' interests, months after the lawsuit was filed in federal district court in Eugene, Ore. The lawsuit seeks an injunction that would force the government to "phase out fossil fuel emissions and draw down excess atmospheric CO2."\nIn their 2015 request to intervene, the trade associations told the court it was "critical" that they be able to defend their members\' interests against efforts by the plaintiffs to "reshape the economy as they see fit. " \n They struck a different tone on Friday. \n"We are confident that the U.S. Department of Justice will rigorously defend its position and that the court will conclude that setting national environmental policy is the role of Congress and the president," a spokesman for AFPM said in an emailed statement.\nIn a 2012 tweet, Donald Trump called climate change a hoax created by the Chinese to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive. During his 2016 presidential campaign, he promised to exit from the Paris Agreement to combat climate change. \n Julia Olson, executive director of Our Children\'s Trust, which represents 21 children and teenagers who are named as plaintiffs in the case, said the trade associations "will not come clean on the facts of climate change because they know it exposes them to liability for the damage they too have caused to the global climate system."\nAt least one similar lawsuit failed at an early stage. But U.S. District Judge Ann Aiken rejected motions to dismiss the case in a November ruling that recognized a "right to a climate system capable of sustaining human life."\nThe ruling triggered preparations for a trial that could begin as early as this year and forced the federal government and the trade associations to answer the lawsuit\'s claims about climate change.\nThe federal government acknowledged, through its lawyers, scientific consensus that the buildup of greenhouse gases due to human activities is "changing the global climate at a pace and in a way that threatens human health and the natural environment."\nBut the three trade associations said in their December response to the lawsuit that they lacked "sufficient knowledge to admit or deny the factual allegations."\nDocuments obtained by the environmental group Greenpeace in 2015 revealed a stream of funding from the fossil-fuel industry to a scientist whose research concluded that human activity isn\'t causing global warming.\nWhen pressed by a federal magistrate judge, API, AFPM and NAM agreed to state their positions on the science of climate change by May 18. They were then granted an extension to May 25.\nNAM filed a motion to withdraw from the case on Monday, followed by motions from API and AFPM on Thursday. If the judge permits the groups to leave the case, they wouldn\'t have to make any statements about climate change.\nExxon Mobil Corp., a member of both API and AFPM, has in recent years voiced support for a carbon tax and the international Paris climate pact.\nBut smaller member companies have privately urged the Trump administration to pull out of the Paris accord. API and AFPM rarely stake out a public position on an issue for which their membership hasn\'t reached consensus.\nNAM\'s board includes representatives of companies that have expressed support for aggressive policies to counter climate change, including General Electric Corp. and Microsoft Corp.\nMs. Olson, who represents the plaintiffs, said the groups were "running for the hills" to avoid discovery, the pretrial exchange of information between parties.\nRepresentatives for the three trade associations declined to address the May 25 deadline and whether it played a role in their decision to leave the case.\nA spokeswoman for API said the group has "full confidence that the courts will recognize that Congress and the executive branch have the constitutional authority to write and execute the laws of the U.S."\nLinda Kelly, NAM\'s senior vice president and general counsel, said the group no longer felt its participation was required to safeguard the industry and its workers, "as dynamics have changed over the last several months."\nChristopher M.

Yet, their suggested form of analysis outside their narrow model. Already counted in the hundreds of thousands a year are deaths associated with crop failures and food scarcity, heat waves and forced relocation. The several-year East African drought may be a harbinger of what\'s to come. Malaria, Zika and dengue among other diseases spread as a warmer climate extends the range mosquitoes travel.\nThe authors\' analysis neglects environmental damage and ecosystem disruption that enters a spiraling feedback loop. Even if you do not believe that humans have a responsibility to stewards of the earth, certainly the damage to systems that support human life should be factored into the equation.\nPaul Susman\nLewisburg, Pa.\n---\nWar, disease and chaos are exactly the stresses to which unchecked climate change will lead. Environmental degradation caused by climate change will drive food shortages, disease, migrations and wars. Even Defense Secretary James Mattis stated in his congressional testimony that "climate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today."\nStephanie Doba\nBrooklyn, N.Y.\n---\nTo assert that carbon dioxide "hurts nobody\'s health" is ignorant. Humans exhale carbon dioxide as a waste product. C02 is linked to myriad deleterious health ailments including respiratory conditions. As a greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide also traps heat in the atmosphere, which contributes to the rising sea level and disrupts weather patterns.\nTed Millar\nMilton, N.Y.\n---\nBillions of years of evolution have created a perfectly balanced ecosystem that sustains life as we know it. Extracting and burning fossil fuel, along with deforestation, disrupts that critical balance.\nThe authors note that pollution and declining wildlife habitats are problems, but they fail to connect these to climate change. The policies that cause climate change also cause pollution and loss of habitats. Fracking emits volatile organic compounds. Pipelines carrying fuel and fracking chemicals leak into waterways and aquifers, and pipeline compressors emit toxins into the air. Habitats are being lost everyday to fossil-fuel drilling. Focusing only on the economics of climate change is fundamentally flawed.\nLisa Harrison\nNew York\n---\nExamining data over the past 21 centuries we see that sometimes we have experienced more-than-average warming and sometimes more-than-average cooling. That fact makes me suspect that eliminating activities that generate CO2 will not do away with climate change.\nThere is a lot of uncertainty regarding the benefits of fighting climate change, but there is more certainty about the costs. Proponents of the Paris agreement estimate that full compliance would reduce the global temperature by 0.17 degrees Celsius by 2100, but that\'s hardly worth the cost. There is no use being Don Quixotes fighting windmills.\nTico Moreno\nSanibel Island, Fla.\n---\nClimate change is the greatest world-wide threat humanity has ever faced.

Eleven years ago, "An Inconvenient Truth" hyped global warming by relying more on scare tactics than science. This weekend Mr. Gore is back with "An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power." If the trailer is any indication, it promises to be more of the same.\nThe former vice president has a poor record. Over the past 11 years Mr. Gore has suggested that global warming had caused an increase in tornadoes, that Mount Kilimanjaro\'s glacier would disappear by 2016, and that the Arctic summers could be ice-free as soon as 2014. These predictions and claims all proved wrong.\n"An Inconvenient Truth" promoted the frightening narrative that higher temperatures mean more extreme weather, especially hurricanes. The movie poster showed a hurricane emerging from a smokestack. Mr. Gore appears to double down on this by declaring in the new film\'s trailer: "Storms get stronger and more destructive. Watch the water splash off the city. This is global warming."\nThis is misleading. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change--in its Fifth Assessment Report , published in 2013--found "low confidence" of increased hurricane activity to date because of global warming. Storms are causing more damage, but primarily because more wealthy people choose to live on the coast, not because of rising temperatures.\nEven if tropical storms strengthen by 2100, their relative cost likely will decrease. In a 2012 article  for the journal Nature Climate Change, researchers showed that hurricane damage now costs 0.04% of global gross domestic product. If climate change makes hurricanes stronger, absolute costs will double by 2100. But the world will also be much wealthier and less vulnerable, so the total damage is estimated at only 0.02% of global GDP.\nIn the trailer, Mr. Gore addresses "the most criticized scene" of his previous documentary, which suggested that "the combination of sea-level rise and storm surge would flood the 9/11 Memorial site." Then viewers are shown footage of Manhattan taking on water in 2012 after superstorm Sandy, apparently vindicating Mr. Gore\'s claims. Never mind that what he actually predicted was flooding caused by melting ice in Greenland.\nMore important is that Mr. Gore\'s prescriptions--for New York and the globe--won\'t work. He claims the answer to warming lies in agreements to cut carbon that would cost trillions of dollars. That would not have stopped Sandy. What New York really needs is better infrastructure: sea walls, storm doors for the subway, porous pavement. These fixes could cost around $100 million  a year, a bargain compared with the price of international climate treaties.\nMr. Gore helped negotiate the first major global agreement on climate, the Kyoto Protocol. It did nothing to reduce emissions (and therefore to rein in temperatures), according to a March 2017 article  in the Journal of Environmental Economics and Management. Undaunted, Mr. Gore still endorses the same solution, and the new documentary depicts him roaming the halls of the Paris climate conference.\nBy 2030 the Paris climate accord will cost the world up to $2 trillion a year, mostly in lost economic growth, according to the best peer-reviewed energy-economic models. It will remain that expensive for the rest of the century. This would make it the most expensive treaty in history.\nAnd for what? Just ahead of the Paris conference, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change estimated  that if every country fulfills every promised Paris carbon cut between 2016 and 2030, carbon dioxide emissions will drop by only 60 gigatons over that time frame. To keep the temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius, the world must reduce such emissions nearly 6,000 gigatons over this century, according to the IPCC. A "successful" Paris agreement wouldn\'t even come close to solving the problem.\nMr. Gore argues that the Paris approach pushes nations and businesses toward green energy. Perhaps, but the global economy is far from ready to replace fossil fuels with solar and wind. The International Energy Agency, in its 2016 World Energy Outlook, found that 0.6% of the world\'s energy is supplied by solar and wind. Even with the Paris accord fully implemented, that number would rise only to 3% in a quarter-century.\nIn part because of activists like Mr. Gore, the world remains focused on subsidizing inefficient, unreliable technology, rather than investing in research to push down the price of green energy. Real progress in Paris could be found on the sidelines, where philanthropist Bill Gates and others, including political leaders, agreed to increase spending on research and development. This is an important start, but much more funding is needed.\nMr. Gore declares in his new film that "it is right to save humanity." No argument here. But is using scare tactics really the best way to go about it?\nMr. Lomborg is the president of the Copenhagen Consensus Center and the author of "The Skeptical Environmentalist" and "Cool It."\nCredit: By Bjorn Lomborg\n'b'Jeffrey GogoClimate Changebr Civil society groups working on climate change have urged the Zimbabwe Government to prioritise adaptation, gender equality and climate finance when countries meet for the annual UN climate negotiations in Bonn, Germany next month.The Climate Change Working Group (CCWG), representing over 50 non-governmental organisations, said it was crucial also for Government authorities to focus on elements that support technology transfer, build institutional capacity to respond to climate change, and raise ambition for cutting carbon emissions.span an Thousands of delegates from nearly 200 countries are expected to meet in Bonn between November 6-17 to develop guidelines the touted "rulebook"on implementing the Paris Agreement on climate change of 2015, among other issues.To this end, Zimbabwe is preparing a report outlining its expectations for that conference.\nThese will then be consolidated into the wider position of the African Group, a coalition of 54 African countries that speak as one in global climate talks.Input from civil society makes for important contribution in the process .The CCWG strongly supports the Paris Agreement\'s key goal of curbing global temperature rise at two degrees Celsius in this century, but wants to see more action that protects women and communities against the dangerous impacts of climate change.\n"The narrative of climate change . . . should dwell more on women and youth empowerment and responsive action as opposed to victim portrayal," said Shepherd Zvigadza, who chairs the civil society climate working group.\nDrawing upon a roadmap on gender agreed in Peru three years ago, Zvigadza said that plan "should continuously feature in discussions given its focus on promoting gender balance, equality and women empowerment." Women in Africa, where agriculture is the economic mainstay supporting over 600 million people, are often seen as the face of climate change.Because women anchor families, providing food and care, they are more often than not in the frontlines when climate impacts strike, which also means they are the first line of defence to similar impacts, say experts.\nRapid measures Zvigadza spoke in the wake of a civil society meeting held in Harare on September 26, to discuss expectations for the impending annual UN climate negotiations.The meeting, which produced a "position paper" that enshrines six key points for attention, was attended by over 65 organisations, including ordinary people, civil society, religious groups, media and business representatives, organisers said.\nIn May, world climate diplomats met in Bonn for the usual annual mid-term talks, a primer for the year-end conference that also includes heads of state and government, but made little progress developing the Paris Agreement rulebook.This is will now be thrashed out at the 23rd meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP23), convening under the auspices of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the multi-lateral platform that has steered climate talks since 1992.\nThe rulebook is expected to provide guidelines on how to keep global temperatures "well below" two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times and "endeavour to limit" them even more, to 1,5 degrees Celsius.\nIt will also include issues on transparency, accountability and finance as agreed in the Paris treaty, as well guidelines on how to review each country\'s contribution to cutting emissions beginning in 2018, and every five years thereafter, with the aim of taking stronger action.The idea is to come up with a book of rules that effectively limits carbon emissions from human activity, to the extent that can be tolerated by trees, oceans and soil, the natural sinks of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, and to be transparent about it.\nAlready, scientific consensus point towards the inadequacy of current pledges, as indicated in the individual country climate plans called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).Scientists say at current level of ambition, the world will warm by upto 3 degrees Celsius in this century, with devastating impacts on agriculture, water, disease and food security.\nTo avoid this catastrophe, and more, African countries have demanded financial and technological help from wealthy nations, blamed for flaring the current climatic chaos.A promise of $100 billion per year beyond 2020 has been made for this purpose, but many aren\'t pleased. They want more, tangibly more.\nNo to debt Zvigadza, the Climate Change Working Group chairman, says the upcoming climate summit should put such sticky issues to rest.\n"Access to adequate, predictable, timely and unconditional climate finances form the basis upon which climate action can be undertaken.The definition of climate finance should exclude loans that are extended to developing countries as they promote perpetual debts for future generations but rather should be limited to grants," said Zvigadza, in a statement.\nZimbabwe needs upto $90 billion to fully implement its climate plan under the Paris Agreement, where it has committed to cut emissions by 33 percent person over the next 13 years.Much of the money is to be invested in cleaner energy projects like solar power and hydro-power, including improving energy efficiency, with $35 billion earmarked for adaptation, mainly in agriculture.\nCommon ground A lot of what the Zimbabwean civil society is pushing for dovetails with what climate negotiators in the Ministry of Environment, Water and Climate are building at in their "position paper" to the African Group.As Zvigadza spoke about how the Paris Agreement rulebook should include firm provisions for "training and capacitating local communities to adapt to climate change" his sentiments echoed loud to what Elisha Moyo, a climate researcher with the Zimbabwe Government, said at the same meeting.\n"Our objectives should centre on ensuring to building the resilience of our communities and economy to climate change and variability," Moyo told the conference, jointly organised Zero Regional Environmental Organisation, Zimbabwe Environmental Lawyers Association and the Zimbabwe Council of Churches, supported by Hivos and Act Alliance.\nMoyo highlighted the need for the Paris accord "to remain favourable to developing nations" by recognising a principle that puts all countries at the same level, but with different capacities and capabilities to respond to climate change.For years, civil society organisations have been involved in climate change advocacy, putting pressure on governments and big businesses to take action against, or risk the dangerous impacts of rising global temperatures.\nGod is faithful.\njeffgogo@gmail.com\n'b"Publication: The Daily Cardinal, University of Wisconsin - Madison, Madison WI.\nWill talk of adapting to climate change be less polarizing politically? Faced with rising seas, Miami is adapting by raising its roads. AP Photo/Lynne Sladky\nConversations about climate change often derail into arguments about whether global warming exists, whether climate change is already happening, the extent to which human activity is a cause and which beliefs are based in evidence versus propaganda.\nCan we have more productive discussions? We think the answer is yes, but like so many things, it depends.\nMany have argued its better to focus on strategic solutions to climate change than on science or politics or pundits. Solutions directly affect our future, whereas past-oriented debates focus on who or what is to blame and who should pay, and thus are highly polarizing.\nBreaking from the old, stale debates sounds appealing, but new debates lie ahead. The solutions to our climate challenges differ from one another not just technically (cutting emissions, carbon capture, planting trees, erecting seawalls and elevating roads and buildings), but also psychologically and behaviorally.\nWhat will be the major disagreements, and agreements, of the future? Are there different psychological and behavioral roadblocks and paths to different climate solutions, and if so, what are they? We have some initial answers to these questions, as well as important questions for going forward.\nTo begin solving the dilemmas of climate change, two primary strategic approaches require discussion: mitigation and adaptation.\nFor years, the primary option and a lightning rod for disagreement has been mitigation, or actions that cut the amounts of carbon and other greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. For many, mitigation is essential; for many others, cutting emissions threatens industry, jobs, free markets and our quality of life.\nNow we are entering a period of adaptation, in which we must try to reduce the impact of the coming changes. Examples include changing agricultural practices, erecting seawalls, and new approaches to architecture and living arrangements.\nIn some ways it is a relief to articulate ways to adapt to climate change. More coping options are better than fewer, right? Well, not necessarily. Their costs and risks differ, their effects are uncertain and varied, and decisions that will drive their deployment can derive from radically different evaluations and judgments.\nWe should not choose between mitigation or adaptation because we need both. We cannot lose sight of this dual need. But we will continue to face very demanding decisions about how to allocate finite resources  money, time, effort and so on  across multiple strategic options. This is where tomorrows difficult conversations will unfold.\nHow will trade-offs be made, and what kinds of perceptions and biases will determine our choices? We will not be able to optimize our strategies, as objectively and effectively as humanly possible, without understanding the psychologies underlying them.\nResearch into the psychology of different climate solutions is in its infancy. A recent study showed how different political ideologies predict different levels of support for free market versus regulatory solutions for cutting carbon emissions.\nBuilding on this foundation, we wanted to ascertain and test peoples differing perceptions of mitigation versus adaptation as climate solutions. Such differences, we presumed, will be crucial in shaping the nature of future conversations, decisions, and actions.\nIn surveys of two online samples in the United States, taken when temperatures around the country differed significantly, we asked respondents to describe their beliefs about global warming and climate change. We separated and defined mitigation and adaptation strategies, and asked how much people were willing to support these different types of climate solutions.\nAs might be intuited, support for mitigation and for adaptation were positively correlated  people who supported one were more likely to support the other. However, while the two overlap, they do understand and perceive the two strategies to be different.\nWe found additional important differences. Overall, mitigation solutions received more support than adaptation strategies. Mitigation was also more divisive, showing the widest divide between conservatives and liberals. Adaptation was less divisive; perhaps this bodes well for future climate-solution conversations and action.\nHowever, a key caveat is crucial for thinking about how we go forward. While we did find less disagreement around adaptation, and some general support, many people probably have not yet been exposed to information or debates about adaptation, or given it much thought.\nPerhaps this novelty represents a naive stage among citizens about any issue before it becomes politicized and polarizing. On the other hand, adaptation more than mitigation is agnostic about climate-change causes; whether climate change results from human causes or natural ones is irrelevant. This may be one reason we found more agreement around adaptation.\nBut what will happen when adaptation is as prominent on everyones radar as mitigation has been for years? Maybe it will become polarizing like mitigation, in which case we should have more of these conversations sooner rather than later.\nLooking ahead, certain questions are crucial: As we engage in more adaptation efforts, what will we do with respect to mitigation? We cannot stop engaging in those vital activities to reduce greenhouse gases. On the other hand, the climate change train has left the station, so we have to adapt. But beware the false choice; we still have to slow the train down through more mitigation.\nTheories offer competing predictions on whether engaging in adaptation will reduce our mitigation efforts. People may feel less urgency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through mitigation if we interpret our adaptation as progress and preparedness, lessening our felt need to mitigate.\nOn the other hand, people may come to see both mitigation and adaptation as a commitment to doing all that is needed to cope with climate change, and view the two solution strategies as complementary rather than substitutes.\nIdeally, adaptation is a gateway strategy for cooperation, a common ground for conversation and the beginnings of continued collaboration. Ideally, too, adaptation efforts will reveal more about the full costs of climate change. After all, action now and at the source (mitigation) is both cheaper and higher leverage than forever adapting into the future.\nAnd now geoengineering  or deliberately altering the climate system, such as shielding the suns heat by injecting particles into the atmosphere  is looming as a possible third solution set. Crucially, geoengineering has a different risk matrix and unstudied implications, both scientific and psychological.\nOnly by understanding the psychology of climate change can we deploy optimal strategies and solution mixes that vary appropriately over time and across different geographies.\nThe authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond the academic appointment above.\nCredit: Kieran O'Connor, Assistant Professor of Commerce, University of Virginia\n"b'Although the Earth\'s climate is constantly changing and global climate change occurs naturally, the rate of future climate change may be more rapid than at any time in the last 10,000 years.\nThe majority of the world\'s scientists studying this topic conclude that this expected climate change will differ from previous climate change because of human activity.\nThe atmosphere has an effect like a greenhouse on the Earth\'s temperature. The energy from the sun reaching the earth is balanced by the energy the Earth emits to space. Greenhouse gases (GHG s) trap some of the energy the Earth releases to space.\nThe greenhouse gases in the atmosphere act as a thermostat controlling the Earth\'s climate. Without this natural greenhouse effect, the average temperature on Earth would be -18[degrees]C instead of the current +15[degrees]C. Therefore, life as we know it would be impossible.\nEnergy levels of GHG s in the atmosphere have increased in the past 100 years. The scientific evidence for this is very solid. In a 1995 scientific assessment, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that "the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate".\nGlobal climate change will mean substantial impacts on the environment, including water resources, fisheries, forests, wildlife and ecosystems. Scientists also predict that the enhanced greenhouse effect could amplify climate variability. For the agriculture industry, changes in temperature or precipitation could affect production on Canadian farms.\nGreenhouse gases differ in their ability to absorb the radiation leaving the Earth. The ability of a gas to trap heat depends on its capacity to absorb and re-emit radiation and on how long the gas remains in the atmosphere.\nThe predicted change in climate will directly affect crop and livestock management decisions such as seeding dates, crop variety choices, pest and disease management, water management strategies and other important factors.\nThis, combined with the fact that GHG emissions change with the type of farming operation and within individual farms, adds another challenge to managing the rapidly changing agriculture industry in a sustainable manner.\nThe agriculture industry already has some tools that reduce GHG emissions, such as direct seeding and other \'best management practices\'. The industry\'s efforts to develop strategies to reduce its GHG emissions will be guided by cost-effective, practical solutions that maintain or improve Alberta\'s competitive position in the international marketplace.\nCredit: The Community Press\nSubmitted Photo / These five-day-old baby lambs and their moms were enjoying the sunshine and springlike weather on Wednesday, April 19 on Scott Reid\'s farm which is located around 10 miles southwest of Chipman.

Geokno, a startup from IIT Kanpur, surveyed the 600 acres to a resolution of half a metre. IISc scientists and their colleagues then used this information to model water flow. The experiment produced such insight that scientists are now working on using similar methods to study the entire city .\nAway from the sea, Bengaluru is not used to heavy rains but has been flooded in recent decades. On August 14, it had the heaviest rainfall in over a century, receiving in a day 88% of rainfall for the entire month.\nCity administrators are worried that with rapid g rowth and climate change, Bengaluru could see disastrous flooding in future -a fact that climate change researchers and hydrologists concur with.\nDisastrous floods in Chennai had inspired an IISc-like exercise from scientists and administrators, but with an immediate application in mind. Soon after the December 2015 deluge, the office of the Principal Advisor to the government of India had IIT Bombay coordinate a programme to develop a real time flood forecast system for Chennai. When complete sometime next year, it will be among the first such systems for the country .  Says Subimal Ghosh, associate professor at IIT Bombay department of civil engineering, "If the forecast system works well for Chennai, it can be extended to other cities."\nHeavy rains and flooding are wreaking worldwide havoc and climate scientists think their frequency will increase over the years. At the same time, they also experience intense heat and long dry spells, thereby putting them at risk for severe health impacts and water shortage.Climate change affects all parts of the planet, but scientists now say cities are going to be affected far more than small towns and villages. In the last few years, they have begun to understand why , and cities around the world are trying to use this knowledge to become more resilient. India is also joining the bandwagon.\nHydrologists and climate researchers know why cities are so vulnerable to cli mate change -they have altered their natural environment so much, they now create their own climates. They create heat islands when buildings absorb heat during the day and release it during the night.Vehicles and factories release aerosol particles. Together, heat and dust affect how clouds behave over a city, predisposing larger cities to intense events.\nAt Purdue University , Dev Niyogi and his collaborators have been researching this and have found patterns in cities that are not represented in global climate models.\nThey found heavy rains tend to focus on certain parts of a city, depending on geography . Niyogi is part of the team studying Bengaluru and findings echo at home as well. "We have found some parts of Bengaluru are more prone to heavy rains," says Pradeep Mujumdar, professor of civil engineering, IISc, who is leading the study.  Globally , researchers are coming up with interesting findings useful for making cities more resilient. In a paper published two months ago in the journal Nature, a team of researchers around the world examined 1,692 of the largest cities and found 60% of them warmed more than twice the average for the rest of the world from 1950 to 2015.\nIn his own work, Niyogi found that a city\'s impact on itself becomes substantial at an extent of 25 km. At Indian urban densities, this size is enough to hold more than a million people. According to the 2011 census, India has 53 cities with a population of more than a million, compared to 35 in 2001.\nBuilding resilience is now a global exercise between scientists, administrators and planners (see How Cities are Planning...). They are trying to reduce heat, build better drainage systems using models that predict floods locations and  create reservoirs -scientists know how and where, based on where it is likely to rain more -that can store flood water. "It is like insurance," says Niyogi. "We have to decide to pay now or later."\nThere are some studies that indicate that cost of inaction can be as high as 1-2% of a country\'s GDP. In 2008, the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) studied impact of climate change on Mumbai and found it very high. Apart from all human costs due to flooding, disease and other problems, Mumbai is likely to face economic costs of \'35 lakh crore by 2050. "It is a scary study," says Prasad Modak, founder of Mumbaibased Environmental Management Centre and adjunct professor at IIT Bombay . "Even after discounting, numbers are very large."\nUnderstanding how cities will behave is the first step in tackling this problem.  Scientists at IISc and some IITs have been looking at combining several models -weather, hydrology , tides -into a prediction system that can forecast a flood from a few hours to a few days in advance. It will also help administrators reduce impact of flooding. "Once we have a system in place," says IIT Madras civil engineering professor Balaji Narasimhan, "we can find out what the city is lacking."\nScientists are also trying to involve administrators and bureaucrats to implement their understanding. Later this month, some of them will meet at IIT Bhubaneswar to compare notes. "I can do anything in my models," says UC Mohanty , professor at the school of earth, ocean and climate sciences at IIT Bhubaneswar. "But I need city administrators to tell me what is possible."\nSome administrators in India now understand the impact of city resilience.T wo ye a r s a g o , t h e Ro c k e f e l l e r Foundation started a programme that saw about 1,000 cities applying, including 35 from India, some multiple times. The foundation selected 100 cities, including four in India -Surat, Chennai, Jaipur and Pune -on the basis a competition that evaluated a city\'s vision and willingness to execute that vision.\nFoundation officials interviewed city officials to understand how seriously they take city resilience. "We never know what kind of challenge a city will face," says Amit Prothi, associate director of 100ResilientCities. "If we make them resilient, they can face whatever challenge comes their way ."\nIn India, Surat is well ahead. It has prepared its strategy and is now working on implementation. Among other kinds of help, 100ResilientCities pairs leaders with aspirants. It has paired Surat with Rotterdam, a world leader in resilient city planning (see How Cities are Planning...). Rotterdam has plenty of experience in how to deal with floods, also one of Surat\'s main challenges. The Gujarat city is also struggles with mobility problems. What Surat does in the end would have implications for all Indian cities.\nHow Climate Change can be Devastating for Cities\nEXTREME HEAT Because of pollution and heat from buildings, cities are usually at a higher temperature than rural areas. Recent studies show that a global increase of temperature of 2 degrees can result in a temperature increase of 4-5 degrees in the cities\nFLOODING When added to poorly designed infrastructure, heavy rains can cause serious and life-threatening floods\nDROUGHT Because of the higher temperature and pollution, cities are likely to get less frequent rainfall. This can lead to droughts, with long gaps between heavy spells of rains. So future cities can be severely water-stressed\nDISEASE OUTBREAKS Increase in heat can create conditions for growth of bacteria, virus and other parasites. Frequent flooding can help mosquitoes and other insects to breed, increasing probability of disease outbreaks\nHow Cities are Planning for Climate Change Internationally\nCHICAGO Its Green Alley Program includes permeable pavements that filter water into the ground, open basins that can catch water, pavements that reflect rather than absorb light and heat and plenty of recycled materials\nROTTERDAM It has a plan to become resilient to climate change by 2025, by strengthening existing dykes and sewage systems. It is building a large set of green roofs, which practise rooftop agriculture and gardening. It is also setting up centres for water retention and structures that capture flood water\nNEW YORK It is working on creating barriers against water and green spaces along the water\'s edge. It is expecting a doubling of the number of days above 32 degree C and has strategies to reduce the heat in vulnerable parts of the city\nBERLIN This German city has been working on a plan that will reduce both floods and hot days, by creating water sponges throughout the city.These include a series of structures along roads and in buildings that will absorb water during rain and cool the city during hot days. It is also making roads and other surfaces that will reflect rather than absorb heat\n'b'Sam Clovis, Donald Trump\'s pick to be chief scientist for the Department of Agriculture, pushed unfounded theories about then-President Barack Obama\'s upbringing and called then-Attorney General Eric Holder a "racist Black," a CNN KFile review of Clovis\'s writings and radio broadcasts during 2012 and 2013 has found.\nClovis was a conservative radio host and political activist in Iowa before gaining national attention as one of the more vocal supporters of Trump during the presidential campaign. His nomination to head science at the USDA requires Senate confirmation.\nCNN\'s KFile reported last week on blog posts from 2011 and 2012 in which Clovis called Black leaders "race traders" and accused Obama of being a "Maoist." CNN\'s KFile has since obtained the transcripts of some episodes of Clovis\' radio show, "Impact with Sam Clovis," reviewed hours of available audio of Clovis\' radio appearances, and uncovered previously unreported blog posts by Clovis.\nThe material shows how Clovis regularly engaged with fringe theories that were prevalent in the rightwing radio and blogosphere during Obama\'s presidency.\nClovis did not return a request for comment. A spokesperson for the USDA and the White House also did not respond to emails requesting comment.\nIn a 2012 blog post archived on the website for the Sioux City-based radio station KSCJ, Clovis raised questions about Obama\'s biography that echoed some of the theories pushed by those in the birther movement who claim that Obama isn\'t an American citizen.\n"For over a decade, Obama allowed his publisher to carry a biography that had him born in Kenya. Only after beginning his pursuit of public office did he \'correct\' the entry," Clovis wrote. (The literary agent who edited the biography has said the error was hers, and that she made it with no direct communication with Obama.)\nClovis then theorized that Obama\'s past connections to left-wing figures went unscrutinized by the media because Obama is Black.\n"Could it be that the first African-American president is being given a pass because he is Black? How incredibly racist is that? The logical conclusion is that because he is Black, he cannot help himself. This kind of thinking is the absolute worst," Clovis wrote.\nClovis also discussed the race of Holder and then-Secretary of Labor Tom Perez, who now heads the Democratic National Committee. In a 2013 episode of "Impact with Sam Clovis," Clovis called Holder "a racist Black" and Perez "a racist Latino."\n"This goes right in line with Tom Perez who is a racist Latino and goes to (inaudible) who is a racist Latino, Eric Holder who is a racist Black," according to a transcript of the show obtained by CNN\'s KFile.\nClovis similarly labeled Holder "a racist bigot" in a blog post from April 2012. Clovis doesn\'t make clear in either instance why he believes Holder and Perez are racist.\nClovis would frequently attack prominent Democratic leaders with insults and epithets. He called then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid "mentally ill" during a September 2013 local Iowa radio appearance and referred to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi as "the Batwoman of Alcatraz" and said "something\'s happened to her brain" in a May 2013 episode of "Impact with Sam Clovis.\nClovis also denied the veracity of climate change science, a belief cited by Senate Democrats and climate activists who have expressed opposition to his nomination for the USDA job.\nClovis told Iowa radio host Jan Mickelson in June 2013 that climate change wasn\'t settled science and argued that progressives changed the term from "global warming" to "climate change" to imply they were going to create the ideal climate around the world.\n"What we have to examine is how the language changes, and when you start to go away from \'global warming\' to \'climate change,\' this goes right into the heart of progressive thinking because what it says, or what the implication is, is that somehow the progressives are going to figure out a way to create the ideal climate in all regions of the earth," he said. "And so how nonsensical is that? If you follow that logic to its logical conclusion, that\'s the conclusion in which you arrive - is that there is some perfect weather or some perfect climate that we will have for everyone - everyone will thrive."\nSpeaking with the same Iowa radio host in February 2014, Clovis agreed with Mickelson\'s assessment that climate change was a way to redistribute wealth and "a big hustle." Clovis also made reference to "Agenda 21," a United Nations action plan on sustainability that right-wing figures have long claimed is an attempt by the internal organization to strip local governments of their sovereignty.\nClovis repeatedly engaged in conspiratorial theories, particularly ones that cast the Obama administration in the most sinister light.\nIn a April 2012 blog post, Clovis expressed his belief that Obama wanted to rule as a dictator and enslave his opponents.\n"This president is a dangerous person," Clovis wrote. "He is dangerous in that he does not have the interests of the nation in mind and is more than willing to do anything to advance an ideology that is absolutely opposed to American exceptionalism. Four more years of this man as president could very well mean the total deconstruction of our Constitutional republic. He wants to be a dictator and he wants to enslave all who are not part of his regime. As Althusius advised in the 17th century, we have a right to throw off imprudent magistrates. The current president certainly qualifies. Vote in November."\nIn a September 2012 episode of his online radio program "Serious Civics with Sam Clovis," Clovis observed that Obama appeared "happy" after the attack on the American embassy in Benghazi, Libya that month.\n"This is something that tells you that he is dismissive of the entire affair and in fact, I would even hate to stretch this out but it\'s almost as if it was intentional. As if he is happy that these things have occurred." Clovis said. "Now I know that\'s harsh and I don\'t have any evidence to support that. But look at his actions. Right after the event, where does he go? He goes and he does an interview on the hip hop guy who is a pimp and on top of everything else. The fact that he goes to Las Vegas and essentially just mentions in passing that we\'ve had four Americans killed in Libya under a premeditated orchestrated attack and he doesn\'t seem to have any more attachment to it than that. This is frightening." - (CNN)\n'b'Rep. David G. Reichert, R-Wash., issued the following news release:\nThis week, Congressman Dave Reichert (R-WA) and a group of Republican lawmakers introduced a resolution calling for American innovation to be used to improve environmental stewardship.\nThe resolution introduced today calls on the House of Representatives to commit to working on economically viable solutions that address the risks of climate change, calling on "American ingenuity, innovation, and exceptionalism," and citing the "conservative principle to protect, conserve, and be good stewards of our environment."\n"We are lucky to live in the world\'s most innovative country with the brightest minds," said Rep. Reichert. "We must use this incredible asset to tackle an issue that impacts all of us regardless of our age, income, or geography. Here in the Pacific Northwest, with Mt. Rainier as our backdrop and the Alpine Lake Wilderness in our backyard, we understand the important role nature plays in our lives and why we must preserve it for future generations. I will continue to work with individuals from all sides of the aisle to improve environmental stewardship and encourage American innovation."\nWhat They\'re Saying:\nDavid Jenkins, President, Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship\n"The significance of this Republican climate resolution cannot be overstated. Real conservatives don\'t deny reality, they face it. They don\'t avoid problems, they tackle them head on. The resolution\'s 17 initial cosponsors are stepping up on an issue that grows more urgent every day, and showing the prudent, fact-based--and yes, conservative--leadership our nation needs. We are grateful for this important first step."\nMark Reynolds, Executive Director, Citizens\' Climate Lobby\n"The risks of climate change are far too great to get bogged down in partisan politics. With this resolution, these 17 Republicans are saying that business-as-usual is unacceptable when it comes to preserving a livable world for future generations. Hopefully, their leadership will help us turn the page and move forward on solutions to this critical problem."\nDiane Randall, Executive Secretary, Friends Committee on National Legislation (The Quaker lobby in the public interest)\n"The leadership demonstrated by the 17 co-sponsors of this Republican climate resolution is such a hopeful step forward. This resolution shows that our moral obligation to address climate change and protect vulnerable communities transcends partisanship, and that there truly is political will to address this issue from both political parties in Congress. Now, more than ever, we pray that Congress will quickly pivot the dialogue towards meaningful climate solutions."\nDan Misleh, Executive Director, Catholic Climate Covenant\n"The Catholic Climate Covenant applauds the moral courage of the 17 Republican legislators who have introduced this resolution. The Catholic Church recognizes the threat that climate change poses to our common home and to human life and dignity - especially of the poor and vulnerable, and of those in future generations. We are heartened that Congress is responding to Pope Francis\'s call in his address to Congress and in Laudato Si to "enter into dialogue with all people about our common home" (Laudato Si\', no. 3). We encourage House members take the next step of joining the bipartisan House Climate Solutions Caucus."\nThe Niskanen Center\n"The sponsors of the Republican Climate Resolution understand that there is nothing conservative about ignoring the enormous risks of climate change. As conservatives, we believe the government exists to protect property rights and lives. It is clear that climate change will put both at risk for our kids and future generations. It is also clear that we have the means to significantly reduce those risks and leave a prosperous and clean future for posterity. The Niskanen Center applauds these Republicans who are looking to take positive steps forward finding practical and market-based solutions for climate change."\nKen Kimmell, President, Union of Concerned Scientists\n"I\'m heartened to see Republican House members introduce a resolution committing Congress to address climate change and base its policy decisions on science and quantifiable facts. While the resolution doesn\'t explicitly make the link to fossil fuel emissions, it shows that these Republican lawmakers are not in a state of denial about this key issue. The U.S. is seeing more extreme weather due to climate change, including flooding, droughts and wildfires, which cost taxpayers billions of dollars in damages. There\'s strength in numbers, and I hope that this sizable group of responsible leaders will have an impact on votes in Congress."\nFrancesco "Frank" Femia and Caitlin Werrell, Co-Founders and Presidents, The Center for Climate and Security\n"This resolution demonstrates that the security risks of climate change are a reality that partisanship cannot continue to obscure. The Department of Defense and intelligence community have recognized this issue across both Republican and Democratic Administrations, and it\'s heartening to see Republican policy-makers from all parts of the country acting on that."\nMindy Lubber, President, Ceres (A nonprofit mobilizing business and investor leadership for a sustainable global economy)\n"Today\'s announcement sends a loud and clear message that addressing climate change need not be a partisan issue. We applaud all lawmakers - no matter their party affiliation - who recognize the urgency of tackling climate change and the enormous economic opportunities of accelerating clean energy in all parts of the United States. The cosponsors of this resolution have shown bold leadership, and we look forward to working with them to craft bipartisan climate solutions that Americans want and expect from Washington."\nThe Rev. Mitch Hescox, President/CEO, The Evangelical Environmental Network (EEN)\n"We are proud of the courageous leadership of Rep. Elise Stefanik (NY-21), Rep. Carlos Curbelo (FL-26), Rep. Ryan Costello (PA-6), and the 14 other Republican co-sponsors of this House Resolution affirming that climate change is a serious problem that must be addressed in order for us to be "good stewards of our environment ...". We heartily concur and stand ready to support efforts to do so".\nHeather Reams, Managing Director, Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions\n"Addressing climate change through clean energy solutions is smart policy and smart politics. Time and again, CRES polling shows that voters overwhelming support lawmakers who prioritize clean energy to advance the economy, create good paying jobs, promote energy independence, and protect the environment."\nAdmiral Frank "Skip" Bowman, U.S. Navy (ret), Member of the Advisory Board, The Center for Climate and Security, Former Director of the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program: "I support this Republican Climate Resolution. Putting aside arguments of cause and effect, there are measured and measurable data and global events that must be considered and accounted for in our defense planning."\nRear Admiral David W. Titley, U.S. Navy (ret), Member of the Advisory Board, The Center for Climate and Security, Former Oceanographer of the Navy: "I\'m very excited to see the Republican Climate Change Resolution introduced to the Congress. Our nation\'s long-term security is critically dependent on moving away from fossil-based fuels to lessen the worst risks of climate change. This change will not happen without support and leadership from the Congress, in partnership with the Administration. The Republican Climate Change Resolution is a good first step towards a serious bi-partisan policy discussion."\nCommander David "Deke" Slayton, U.S. Navy (ret), Member of the Advisory Board, The Center for Climate and Security: "The Republican Climate Resolution ably and well serves as an imperative and call for action for our Nation. The resolution captures the issues of an observable, changing climate and the dynamic events we see unfolding in the worlds oceans today. These critical events demand U.S. Congressional and national executive leadership, now. "\nSherri Goodman, Member of the Advisory Board, The Center for Climate and Security, Former Deputy Undersecretary of Defense: "The Republican Climate Resolution, whose signers represent a broad cross-section of America affected by climate change, from our coasts to rural agricultural areas, soundly recognizes that climate change is a "threat multiplier" that will adversely affect our national security interests as well as all Americans, where we live and work. The leaders of this effort should be commended for recognizing that we need both to study and address changes in our global and regional climates, and build more resilient communities for America\'s future."\nVice Admiral Lee Gunn, U.S. Navy (ret): "I am enthusiastically adding my support for this Republican Climate Resolution (Ms. Stefanik, et al., \'Expressing the commitment of the House of Representatives to conservative environmental stewardship.\'). The resolution acknowledges, among other things, the enormous national security importance of stewardship of the environment for America. Our armed services depend on predictable conditions at home for training, maintenance, drills and exercises, and bases, all components of building ready military forces. Also, the demands worldwide on not only our military but our economic, diplomatic and political power, demands on all elements of our national power, will inevitably be greater if the environment becomes less predictable. The Republican Climate Resolution supports not only traditional American values, but the practical imperative of maintaining our security at home and abroad."\nColonel Lawrence Wilkerson, U.S. Army (ret), former chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell, Visiting Professor of Government and Public Policy, the College of William and Mary: "The Republican Climate Change Resolution being introduced in the Congress--the Gibson Resolution under new leadership--symbolizes my political party\'s recognition of climate change\'s impact on national security, an impact already being felt from the shipyards at Hampton Roads to the Ship Channel in Houston, Texas. Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and her 16 Republican co-sponsors are to be congratulated for their herculean efforts to bring my political party to a firm recognition of these risks."\n07M-Vitin-5807151 07M-Vitin\n'b'ABU DHABI, 22nd March, 2017 (WAM) -- Dr. Thani bin Ahmed Al-Zeyoudi, Minister of Climate Change and Environment, said that the UAE has long recognised that the environment is an issue of concern that goes beyond law and legislation, and should be part of a community culture of understanding which is reflective of the wise leadership\'s dedication of a vital part of the UAE Vision 2021 to climate change and the environment.\nThe UAE is aware of its responsibility to ensure the protection of the environment and reduce the consequences on the ecosystem of climate change for the benefit of future generations, the Minister said at the International Government Communication Forum, IGCF 2017, in Sharjah on Wednesday.\nIn an interview with the Emirates News Agency, WAM, Dr. Al-Zeyoudi added, "This important element of Vision 2021 also ensures that the UAE is working to mitigate the impact of climate change resulting from human activities by adopting a clear methodology and precautionary regulatory measures that will reduce carbon emissions."\nHe pointed out that the UAE has advanced its efforts to combat climate change and that the country is steadily moving towards achieving the best results as part of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs.\nThe Minister of the Environment expressed his appreciation of IGCF 2017, adding that the forum is an important tool for governments to address the challenges posed by climate change and how its impact can be reduced by correcting mis-perceptions regarding the issue.

The laws of nature are not negotiating with us. The laws of nature don\'t care about us at all.\nWe continue to fret about the costs of taking action without counting the costs of doing nothing. As we sleepwalk ever further into a dangerous warming scenario, what we truly cannot afford is any more complacency.\nKevin Farmer, Toronto\n'b'Anote Tong, the former president of the Central Pacific island of Kiribati, stood in the Salt Lake City airport, staring blankly at the luggage carousel, waiting for a suitcase that would not arrive.\nAs he wandered off in search of someone who could help, Matthieu Rytz went after him. The Montreal photographer and filmmaker has been following Tong for five years. The resulting documentary, Anote\'s Ark, had its world premire Friday night at the Sundance Film Festival\'s most prestigious venue, the intimate Egyptian Theatre.\nOn Tuesday, Tong and Rytz will have lunch with Sundance founder Robert Redford, after which Tong has been invited to take part in an environmental-themed panel, hosted by the Hollywood legend. In other words, Sundance is rolling out the red carpet for Anote\'s Ark.\n"It\'s an amazing experience," Rytz said Saturday. "But the truth is I have no point of reference. It\'s my first movie, my first launch ever. People around me are more excited. I am too, but I think I don\'t understand the meaning of (having) a premire Friday night in front of a full house at the Egyptian. I tell people about it and they\'re like, \'What?!\'" Friday\'s screening was a hit.\nRytz\'s film is a visually stunning, nuanced account of Tong\'s fight to save his idyllic island from the increasingly devastating effects of climate change.\nIf things continue the way they\'ve been going, Tong believes, Kiribati\'s 115,000 inhabitants will have to find a new home within the next century. Rytz\'s camera trails him as he travels the world, attempting to rouse world leaders from their inaction.\nTong received a standing ovation as he joined Rytz and members of Montreal\'s EyeSteelFilm team Friday night, after being announced as a surprise guest. He commanded the stage in the ensuing Q&A, demonstrating the same mix of charisma, intelligence and eloquence that makes Anote\'s Ark so compelling.\n"It\'s not an academic exercise for me," Tong said, sitting with Rytz on Saturday. "It\'s highly emotional. I\'m looking at my grandchildren, asking myself what is to become of them. It\'s not something I enjoy doing or think is fun. It\'s something that is absolutely necessary.\n"It\'s getting desperate. Solutions continue to be evasive.\nPeople regard (climate change) as something that may or may not happen, but the science is categorical: it\'s happening.\n"I was just asked (by a journalist) recently, \'What are you going to do about it?\'I said, \'What are you going to do about it?\'" Tong recently stepped down as president of Kiribati, having served the limit of three terms. But he has not stopped campaigning.\nHe is a distinguished fellow at American NGO Conservation International\'s Center for Oceans, as well as an ambassador for Swedish non-profit Global Challenges Foundation. And he\'s the chair of a high-level group to review the governance structure of the Commonwealth Secretariat.\nSomehow, amid all his activity and responsibilities, he found six days to come to Sundance in support of Rytz\'s film.\n"I see this as part of the campaign," Tong said. "Really, the question for me is, \'What impact will it have on the campaign?\'I think it\'s a very powerful tool."\nHe\'s not alone. Redford, a longtime environmentalist, asked for his own DVD copy of the film, and appears keen to use his festival to help spread Tong\'s message.\n"I would like to invite Robert Redford to be part of the program," Tong said. "We need people to invest their inspiration and passion. I work with a lot of celebrities. Harrison Ford is on the CI (Conservation International) board; I work closely with him. Robert Redford would be a good addition. It\'s a human issue. We need very good human beings to do this." tdunlevy@postmedia.com twitter.com/TChaDunlevy\nSUNDANCE SNAPSHOT\nMartha Wainwright was the musical guest Saturday night as actress Maggie Gyllenhaal hosted a party for a couple of hundred people in the ski resort-like Hotel Park City.

What does matter is that some people like Shamel believe that their opinion and supporting facts matter so much that any opposing opinion does not deserve the same free speech rights.\nAt the same time I am sure Shamel would protest against restrictions on human rights in other countries, like Russia, she wants to restrict such human rights here in the United States and actually endorses the method of censorship used by the Los Angeles Times. The speech restriction Shamel supports has proven to be the first step in controlling and subverting human rights and is directly in line with the theories put forth by Karl Marx.\nMany problems we are seeing today, including university students refusing to listen or participate in reasoned conversation, arise from this form of arrogance.

Brandon Giuda\nChichester\nWe need Alcohol Fund now more than ever\nThe New Hampshire House Finance Committee's recent decision to not only de-fund the state's Alcohol Prevention and Treatment Fund, but to vote the fund out of existence, is ill advised to say the least.\nFinance Committee Division III Chairman Frank Byron justified the move by citing limited revenue resources. His own words were: We did the best we could. We are aware of the needs related to alcohol and drug misuse.\nWell, it's not good enough. The fund, created by legislation in 2000 and put into action in 2003, stipulated that 5 percent of gross profits from the state's lucrative alcohol sales be allocated to prevention and treatment of substance misuse. (Though named the Alcohol Fund, the law expressly included other substance misuse in its purview.)\nThe fund was intended to provide a stable, ongoing resource for prevention and treatment. In its history, it has only been fully funded at the 5 percent level once  in 2003, the first year of enactment.\nThe fund's existence calls attention to our state's ongoing serious problem with this issue, and makes it harder to hide the fact that the committee is voting to balance the budget on the backs of those struggling with  and dying of  the disease of addiction and their families.\nAlso bear in mind that the fund was enacted a good decade before the current opioid crisis, or at least widespread awareness of the issue. Has the need decreased, or increased, in that time?\nMike Bradley\nHillsboro\n(The writer is a licensed alcohol and drug counselor.)\nClimate hypocrisy\nMajor climate change/global warming conferences have been held annually for more than two decades, including in Geneva, Switzerland; Kyoto, Japan; Buenos Aires, Argentina (twice); The Hague, Netherlands; Bonn, Germany; Marrakech, Morocco; New Delhi, India; Milan, Italy; Montreal, Canada; Nairobi, Kenya; Bali, Indonesia; Pozna, Poland; Copenhagen, Denmark; Cancn, Mexico; Durban, South Africa; Doha, Qatar; Warsaw, Poland; Lima, Peru; and Paris. Also, there were two sustainability conferences held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\nThese locations sound like a bucket list that would be a dream for most of us to see  financially impossible for most of us to ever visit  but are a perk for the thousands of researchers, bureaucrats and administrators who attend climate conferences at taxpayer expense. Also attending are some celebrities with very deep pockets.\nMany of the researchers live in the United States and the United Kingdom, but none of the major conferences have ever been held in either nation.\nThey are generally scheduled as 12-day conferences, so there is plenty of time to spend outside of presentations and meetings to have fun and sightsee. There is considerable partying and conspicuous consumption, and every available limo is rented for the duration.\nIt is enormously hypocritical for the very same people who admonish the rest of the world about fossil fuel consumption to have carbon footprints the size of Godzilla.\nConsidering the fact that teleconferencing and videoconferencing have been around for many years, this behavior shows contempt for the world they claim to be trying to save.\nAnd this is climate change sanity?\nJAMES M. DODSON\nConcord\nConnect climate dots\nMany thanks to Dr. Elizabeth Cramer for her excellent My Turn piece in the March 27 Monitor, headlined Climate change and the health of our children.\nThe article encourages climate awareness for parents, grandparents and all those who care about our children's future health and well-being.\nBeyond her comments about the negative impacts for children, and connecting some dots, it's interesting to note that the same issue of the Monitor had the article, Snowmobile deaths rise this season in N.H.; weather said to be a factor.\nSnowmobiling contributes nearly $600 million to the state annually. Earlier, on March 1, the Monitor commented on a dogsled race being canceled due to warm weather. Then there is the reduction in the state's moose population, and moose hunting permits, caused by warmer weather-induced moose tick infestations, and so on and on.\nI won't get into the potential long-term impact of climate change for skiing, snowshoeing, maple syrup making, leaf peeping, and agriculture, but please, folks, connect the dots, and show your concern by participating in the numerous marches supporting climate action on April 22 and 29.\nRoger Shamel\nHillsboro\n"b'ALBUQUERQUE - When the trees are bare, climate scientist and meteorologist David Gutzler has an unobscured view of the Sandia Mountains from his office window. On the second floor of The University of New Mexico\'s Northrop Hall, the four seasons transform just beyond the glass. From this vantage point, since the mid-\'90s, Gutzler has watched the effects of a warming climate on the state\'s landscape.\n"We are on the front lines - like it or not - of climate change," he said on a recent morning. "The temperature is warming very rapidly across the Southwest. In this climate, we see the manifestation more clearly than anywhere else in the world."\nGutzler, 62, has spent the last two decades teaching climatology and meteorology at UNM but said he never expected that his field of study, which has focused on monsoonal patterns, drought and the impacts of climate change on state water resources, would be the subject of so much controversy.\nThe evidence: a plastic-covered copy of the British tabloid newspaper The Sun dating back to September 1999, that sits in Gutzler\'s office. The cover reads, "Deadliest Storms Ever Heading At You!" in large font alongside grainy photographs of violent lightning and a mother and child clutching one another as a tornado approaches.\nThe storm story outranked "Bad Girls of the Bible," Gutzler said, picking up the paper from its place next to photographs of his adult children and wife, a geologist, who occupied the office next door until she retired.\nWhen he saw the magazine on a newsstand, he said, it seemed like a rare moment when the weather outranked more salacious news.\nBut that has changed. Extreme hurricanes, fires and earthquakes dominated headlines in 2017. And almost daily, the validity of policy enacted by the Obama administration to prevent global warming through international commitments and domestic policy are disputed and unwound by the Trump administration. It\'s a debate that resonates deeply in New Mexico, where environmental concern and an oil-driven economy are often at odds.\n"If people demand iron-clad proof that humans are changing the climate, then we can\'t react,"Gutzler said. "But from my perspective, there has been such a mountain of evidence - to toss all that out because there are uncertainties would be choosing stupidity."\nGutzler\'s profession is based on an ever-evolving science of prediction and how finite environmental conditions - the precise interaction between the amount of atmospheric moisture and the velocity of the wind - correlate to the weather tomorrow, next winter and, ultimately, decades from today.\nUncertainty is what first drew Gutzler to the field. As an undergraduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, he intended to study physics but, on a whim, signed up for a meteorology lecture. The professor introduced him to the principles of chaos theory, based on meteorologist Edward Lorenz\'s research on what is now known as the butterfly effect.\n"I was hooked," Gutzler said.\nHe would go on to earn his doctoral degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Lorenz taught and had first discovered his theory.\nThen, during the winter of 1983, a massive El Nio storm pattern hit the country, and it was the first time meteorologists were able to synthesize the data in real time.\nI "stumbled into the climate prediction problems when it was being turned into a science," he said, "rather than an art."\nSoon after, Gutzler said, a kind of wall came down between weather researchers. Previously, there had been a divide between scientists interested in short-term climate variability and those studying long-term global warming.\nBut by the early \'90s, "scientifically, it became harder to ignore the fact that the overall climate system was changing," he said. "The boundaries between those scientific communities came down."\n"Global warming affects the way we think about next winter\'s forecast now," Gutzler said. "All these phenomena start to blend into longer term climate change."\nAfter earning his doctorate, Gutzler went on to join the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colo.\nThere was an effort at NOAA to explain science to policymakers based on the "assumption that politicians would care," he said, by way of explaining that the Trump administration is far from the first to question climate change.\nDuring the administration of George H.W. Bush, research related to global warming was questioned and was not implemented into policy, but these questions led to an influx of federal funds to enable researchers to better understand the field.\nWhen Gutzler followed his wife, geologist Jane Selverstone, to New Mexico in 1995, climate research was a relatively unexamined field.\n"There was essentially nobody thinking about these issues at UNM," he said. "I was given a clean slate. I had the academic freedom to pursue whatever I wanted to pursue."\nThat has not changed.\nHe shares a five-year, $5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture with researchers from New Mexico State University and the University of Texas at El Paso, which together are developing an integrated water model for the region based on climate change.\nOn a whiteboard in his office, scatter grids plot the amount of snowpack, as it is influenced by increasing evaporation, correlated to warmer temperatures and river flow. It\'s a sphere of knowledge that has wide implication for state water usage and agriculture.\n"Whatever dreams I had about discovering the silver bullet have not panned out," Gutzler said. "But we\'ve learned a lot along the way."\nThe chaos of evolving weather systems still captivate him, and one or two new graduate students ponder the theories with him each year. His classes routinely fill up.\n"What we see in the data, the temperature is rising with a rate consistent with a middle-road climate change based on greenhouse gases," Gutzler said. "If we extrapolate out ... the analogy I draw is the climate in the Albuquerque area would be roughly similar to El Paso."\nNearly 300 miles south, the Texas border town is noticeably hotter and surrounded by treeless mountains.\n"That is where we are headed," Gutzler said. "The question in my mind is not if we we are headed there, but how rapidly."\nThis story first appeared in The New Mexican, a sibling publication of The Taos News.

The State has fallen 28 places to 49th out of 56 countries ranked in the 2018 Climate Change Performance Index. \nThe report, produced by Germanwatch and the New Climate Institute (NCI), says "greater efforts have been made globally to reduce greenhouse gas emissions" and highlights positive developments on switching to renewable energy sources and energy efficiency. However, it says "no country is doing enough to prevent dangerous greenhouse gas emissions". \nProgress on this front was was still not in line with the commitments contained in the Paris Agreement on climate change and all countries must deliver much stronger policies to reduce polluting emissions, the report adds. \nIn light of steps taken by the Trump administration, the US is placed 56th on the index but the report points to positive action being taken by individual US states, cities and companies in reducing CO2 emissions. \nRenewable energy  The index ranks the 56 countries whose combined emissions account for 90 per cent of the world\'s greenhouse gases. The analysis is based on evaluating emissions; adoption of renewable energy; energy use; and climate policy. \nReport co-author Jan Burck told The Irish Times  that rising emissions were Ireland\'s difficulty, even though performance on this front had improved in the past five years. \nThe State was "nowhere close to being on track" in its commitments to keep global temperatures to within 2 degrees" currently and up to 2030. However, he did note "a very positive trend in the development of renewable energy". \nThe report, which comes as delegates from 200 nations gather in Bonn to discuss climate action at COP23, places Sweden at the top of the index in fourth position - the first three positions were left empty as "no country is doing enough to prevent dangerous climate change", the report states. \nAgricultural emissions \nDietary changes in livestock and more efficient fertiliser use could play their part in reducing agricultural emissions, added Prof Niklas Hhne of NCI. \nJerry Mac Evilly, policy co-ordinator for the Stop Climate Chaos coalition, said the report "lays bare the continuing and disturbing contradiction between Government rhetoric on climate change and the sad reality of policy implementation in Ireland". \nIreland\'s polluting emissions are rising and the State is failing to meet EU obligations, he added. \n"The Government is not supporting greater EU ambition and, despite some positive noises, there is little indication that this situation is likely to change any time soon. This hypocrisy on climate change not only has significant reputational damage for Ireland but brings with it extremely negative impacts for our economy, our local environment and our health." \nCara Augustenborg of Friends of the Earth Ireland said the Citizens\' Assembly put forward 13 concrete recommendations for climate action to allow Ireland to catch up with our European neighbours "and end nearly a decade of dithering and delay". \n"Yet at national level, we\'ve seen a new climate action plan which does not guarantee any immediate reductions in pollution. And at EU level, we\'ve seen repeated Government efforts to have loopholes inserted into EU legislation currently under negotiation which would hinder greater climate action."\nCredit: Jack Power, Kevin O\'Sullivan\n'b'Could proof grow any more powerful that humanity is responsible for a dangerously warming planet? Scientists studying Earth\'s atmosphere and oceans are finding ever more troubling evidence.\nLast year was the hottest on record, according to a report late last week from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The report, by more than 450 scientists from 60 nations, also found greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and global sea levels are at their highest levels on record.\nJust as troubling were draft findings destined for the quadrennial National Climate Assessment. Scientists from 13 federal agencies found that a rapid rise in temperatures since the 1980s in the United States represents the warmest period in 1,500 years.\nThe impacts from human-caused warming are no distant threat, the scientists concluded, but are punishing populations right now with weather made worse by climate change: more heat and drought in the American Southwest, larger and fiercer storms along the Pacific, and greater rainfall elsewhere.\n"Many lines of evidence demonstrate that human activities, especially emission of greenhouse gases, are primarily responsible," the draft says. "There are no alternative explanations."\nThe stark threat from climate change is why nearly 200 nations joined together under the Paris Agreement, signed last year, to curb emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide. It\'s also why 40 countries, and a group of Republican elder statesmen in the United States, support worthy plans for a refundable carbon tax that puts a price on greenhouse gas emissions created by the burning of fossil fuels.\nThe question now is how the Trump administration, which is stocked with climate skeptics and is pulling the United States out of the Paris accord, will react to the latest scientific findings. The White House could decide as early as Friday whether to order changes in the draft National Climate Assessment report.\nEnvironmentalists such as Al Gore and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg say Trump\'s rejection of the science only compels state and local governments to act more aggressively to head off catastrophic climate change.\nThere is that hope.\nBut much damage can still be done. A recent study has shown that just four years of Trump\'s recalcitrant environmental policies would add an additional 12 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.\nIt\'s bad enough when President Trump defies the truth when he talks about millions of undocumented immigrants voting against him in the election, or the crowd size at his inauguration. At least those falsehoods provide grist for late-night comics.\nThe same cannot be said for defying the overwhelming scientific consensus about human-caused climate change and actively working against global efforts to stave off calamity. That\'s placing the future of the planet, and the lives of its inhabitants, in jeopardy.\n'b'Early in June, Donald Trump formally withdrew the United States from the Paris Accord, a key international agreement that aims to limit global warming. While not unexpected, the US president\'s action dismayed scientists, environmentalists and concerned citizens worldwide. Indeed, the withdrawal of the world\'s leading economic power from the accord represents a significant step backwards in international efforts to curb the emission of greenhouse gas emissions linked to climate change. \nMany right-wing news outlets described Trump\'s move in terms of the faithful delivery of a campaign promise. While true, the development may have serious consequences. As one of the world\'s largest emitters of greenhouse gases (and the largest per capita), for the US to walk away from its commitments threatens lasting damage to an international agreement to mitigate climate change, not least because of the danger of other major nations following suit. \nHow did we end up in a scenario when the democratically elected leader of the world\'s only superpower has a mandate to ignore a threat clearly identified by scientists? Commentators may despair at Trump\'s crude populism, but it must be acknowledged his approach reflects that of a great many US Republican politicians and voters. Indeed, it is an uncomfortable truth almost any contemporary Republican president would probably have withdrawn the US from the Paris Accord. \nIn that case, how did we end up in a scenario where roughly half the population of the US rejects the findings of modern science? Many answers to this question have been suggested, but I find the simplest the most convincing: namely, people tend to believe something if they are told it often enough. Thus the constant attempts, for many years now, of right-wing newspapers and television stations to downplay and undermine the findings of climate scientists have had a clear effect, particularly in the US. \nIt has become almost an article of faith among a great many conservative voters that the effect of greenhouse gas emissions on global climate is a myth, perpetrated by gullible liberals. Indeed, such "climate scepticism" is not limited to the US, but is common among political conservatives throughout the English-speaking world. \nClimate scepticism Probing deeper, one might ask why climate scepticism has become such an article of faith among \nconservative opinion-makers. Is it a question of short-term capitalist greed or a question of deep-rooted political conviction? According to Harvard historian Naomi Oreskes, both likely play a role. Certainly, a core principle of political conservatism is the minimisation of state interference in the business of commerce, and in the wrong hands, this can become a dangerous ideology. \nThus, sensible legislation to safeguard drinking water standards can be recast as job-killing interference, and legislation to curb greenhouse gas emissions can be portrayed as an assault on the fossil fuel industry. In addition, some corporations have extremely deep pockets that can finance entire news outlets and buy political influence at the highest levels, with devastating results. \nThus, Trump\'s attitude to the Paris Accord can be seen as a symptom of a much wider malaise: the rise of a firm rejection of expert opinion by vested interests. This trend is most obvious when one considers the personnel appointed by the Trump administration to executive positions of major US environmental organisations, where political allegiance has triumphed over expertise in every case. The result has been a drastic cut in the funding of important research in key areas such as climate science. \nOne suspects a price may have to be paid for Trump\'s action. In the short term, we can expect America to fall behind in the burgeoning industry of renewable energies. In the longer term, any failure to address greenhouse gas emissions threatens an increase in drought in the hottest countries in the world and increased flooding in low-lying nations, raising the prospect of many regions becoming uninhabitable. It is a tragic irony that those who resist action on climate change tend to resist immigration with the same ferocity, unaware that inaction on climate risks a human migration on an unprecedented scale.

But America will continue to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions "regardless of what President Trump says or does or tweets," Gore said during a talk sponsored by the Commonwealth Club.\nHe struck an optimistic tone, telling attendees they should take hope from both the swiftly dropping costs of renewable energy technologies like wind and solar power as well as local and state leaders who were picking up the mantle of addressing climate change.\nGore shouted out Gov. Jerry Brown, who he said won an "amazing legislative victory last week" when the state Legislature passed Brown\'s plan extending California\'s signature cap-and-trade system.\nMonday\'s event marked the release this week of Gore\'s second movie, "An Inconvenient Sequel," following up on the 2006 documentary "An Inconvenient Truth." The film follows Gore around the world as he lobbies presidents and prime ministers at climate summits and hugs people who\'ve had their homes washed away by flooding and hurricanes.\nThe movie originally intended to show the world coming together to meet a shared challenge. But that narrative was derailed by Trump\'s election and his decision in June to withdraw from the Paris accord, in which nearly every country committed to emissions reduction targets intended to keep the planet from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius over preindustrial levels.\nGore  who helped negotiate the anti-emission Kyoto Protocol in 1997 only to see President George W. Bush pull out of it  tried to convince Trump to stay in the Paris agreement during personal conversations at Trump Tower and the White House, he said. Trump has voiced doubts that man-made activity is responsible for rising global temperatures and called the notion a Chinese hoax.\n"I really did think there was a chance he would come to his senses," Gore said, "but I was wrong about that."\nBut he said he was heartened that other countries around the world didn\'t use Trump jumping ship as an excuse to get out of their own commitments  "almost as if they were saying, Well, we\'ll show you, Donald Trump.\' "\nEven as an adoring San Francisco crowd cheered him and gave him a standing ovation, Gore argued that the climate movement should do more to reach out to conservatives and Republicans, citing the story of a small Texas town converting to renewable energy to save money.\nMany Republicans in Congress are in the "climate closet," he said  they believe in human-created climate change and want to do something to fight it but are "scared to death" that they\'ll face a well-funded primary challenge if they say so publicly.\nThat\'s slowly changing, he argued: "I think the dam may break soon."\nWhile most of his talk focused on climate change and his new movie, Gore also obliquely addressed the ongoing Trump-Russia scandal. In response to a question about collusion, he said that "the next few months are going to be a real challenge for our country and we best gird ourselves for it." (As a U.S. senator and representative from Tennessee, Gore actually focused much more on national security issues than on environmentalism.)\n"I\'m heartened by the slowly increasing number of Republicans who have said things that lead me to believe they are going to be prepared," he added, seeming to refer to a possible impeachment against Trump. "I think there is now a chance that they will step up to the plate if history and destiny call them out."\nCredit: By Casey Tolan, ctolan@bayareanewsgroup.com\n'b'Climate change negotiations are often fraught with tension. Developing countries want the developed world to pay for their carbon emission-fuelled industrial growth, while the US and Europe want emerging economies like India to commit to sustainable growth.\nCentral to this debate is how the developed countries should "pay" and one way is for them to provide funds to middle-income and low-income nations to mitigate and adapt to climate change. That, in a nutshell, is climate finance.\nThis may sound simple, but the reality is anything but. Despite the concept of climate finance being as old as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) itself, which turned 25 this June, experts are still grappling with what can be categorised under climate finance. "Devel oping countries have been pushing for cli mate finance to be defined, but developed countries have refused to be drawn into that debate," says Indrajit Bose, a senior climate change research officer at Third World Net work, a non-governmental organisation (NGO). The ambiguity over its definition and the absence of compulsory reporting and rig orous accounting of funding have given crit ics of climate finance ample ammunition.\nGlobal public climate finance could be provided by dedicated climate funds or multilateral development banks (MDBs) like the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank, or bilaterally between countries. Nearly half of these are given as concessional loans and a tenth as grants. Liane Schalatek, associate director, Heinrich Bll Foundation North America, says there is a debate over whether loans which, even if low-cost, come with the obligation of repayment, should be accounted for in the same way as grants.\nA Billion Dollar Promise\nIn 2014, according to a report by Climate Policy Initiative (CPI), climate finance flows totalled $391 billion, of which 38% was public money and the rest investments by the private sector in renewable energy. But of the total public climate finance, three-fourths were raised by countries domestically. While it is not clear how much of the total global finance has India received, of the $15.3 billion approved by climate funds, India has got approvals for over $1 billion, more than any other country, and the biggest projects are not surprisingly in the renewable energy sector. Gireesh Shrimali, India director at CPI, says countries prioritise climate goals differ\nently. "In India, energy access and security is a priority. So much of India\'s climate plan is about scaling up renewable energy."\nIndia\'s per capita energy consumption is a third of the global average and nearly a fifth of its population does not have access to electricity. India accounted for well under a tenth of the world\'s carbon dioxide emissions in 2014. Two-thirds of India\'s installed power capacity is fossil fuel-based, but the Narendra Modi administration is keen on ramping up renewable energy generation. It is targeting a capacity of 175 gigawatt by 2022, which is three times the current capacity. More importantly, the objective is to ensure that more than half of the targeted capacity is solar power, whose  share in renewable energy is only 22.5% now. The government is providing subsidies of \'150 billion in the first phase under the National Solar Mission.\nClimate funds like the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Trust Fund, which was the first of its kind; the Adaptation Fund; and the Green Climate Fund (GCF) are under the UNFCCC. Climate Investment Funds (CIF), which includes the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), were set up by MDBs. The GCF is the world\'s largest fund, with donor pledges of $10.3 billion and the CTF the second biggest, with $5.6 billion.\nThe CTF has approved over $750 million for renewable energy projects in India. (China, the world\'s largest CO2 emitter, has not taken any money from CIF.) Jagjeet Singh Sareen, senior policy officer, CIF, says they usually finance an eighth of the project cost. The GCF has greenlit just one project in India, a groundwater recharge and solar micro irrigation initiative in Odisha. The GCF is financing $34 million of the total $166 million project cost, with the rest being footed by the state government and the World Bank.The GCF and the GEF did not respond to requests for comment nor did Environment Ministry officials.\nThe 2030 Water Resources  Group (WRG), a partnership between MDBs, bilateral donors, private companies and NGOs, is helping Maharashtra secure $270 million financing from the GCF as part of a $1 billion project on climate-resilient agriculture, especially in the drought-prone Marathwada and Vidarbha regions. "We prefer projects that leverage private sector investment," says Bastiaan Mohrmann, 2030 WRG\'s co-lead for Asia.\nJairam Ramesh, former Union environment minister, while commending India\'s focus on renewables, believes dealing with climate change goes beyond that. As part of a landmark climate accord signed in Paris in October 2015, India agreed to reduce the volume of carbon emissions per unit of GDP by  a third by 2030 from 2005 levels and said it would need $2.5 trillion for that and other mitigation and adaptation efforts.\nThe Paris Agreement, as it has come to be known, aims to restrict the global temperature rise this century to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to strive to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nDeveloped countries agreed at the Copenhagen climate conference in 2009 to direct $100 billion in "new and additional" funds, both public and private, to developing countries by 2020. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2015 issued a report that said climate finance flows increased from $52 billion in 2013 to $62 billion in 2014.\nHome Finance\nRamesh says India must invest in adaptation and mitigation on its own and not depend on international climate finance. "If that is forthcoming, well and good, but we should not link domestic actions to availability of finance from abroad. We must make investments on our own, keeping in mind our unique vulnerabilities to climate change." India has had an action plan on climate change since 2008, which includes, besides the National  Solar Mission, programmes to promote sustainable agriculture, water conservation and conservation of the Himalayan ecosystem, which had a budget of \'550 crore in the last five years, among others.In the last fiscal, the Centre sanctioned \'251 crore for state government projects under the National Adaptation Fund (NAF).\nMitigation deals with reducing greenhouse gas emissions and is mostly identified with renewable energy and energy efficiency. Adaptation, meanwhile, includes making agriculture climate-resilient and helping coastal communities deal with flooding caused by a rise in sea levels, among other objectives."Adaptation is a matter of life and death for developing countries," says Bose. Climate financing till recently had a clear bias toward mitigation: in 2013 and 2014, 70% of climate change aid from climate funds and 82% of MDBs\' funding were directed to mitigation efforts, but that is changing, with more funds  being made available for adaptation.\nWhile the stress on adaptation is welcome, there is still no consensus on how much money is actually flowing from the developed world to developing countries. The Indian government issued a scathing rebuttal to the OECD report in 2015. "Climate change finance flows need to be precisely that: measured flows, meaning, disbursed funds crossing borders. Not promises, pledges, or multi-year commitments about promised sums in the future." It goes on to question redirection of funds meant for development purposes to climate change and the lack of verification of climate funding by MDBs. "Developed countries do climate finance accounting the way the like. This raises the temperature in negotiation rooms," says a senior Indian government official dealing with climate finance, requesting anonymity, and with no pun intended.\nThe other major hurdle to climate finance is US President Donald Trump\'s threats to pull out of the Paris Agreement and his refusal to continue US contributions to climate funds; the US has pledged $5.8 billion to climate funds. While it has fulfilled its pledge to the CIF, it is unlikely to pay the remaining $2 billion of its $3 billion commitment to the GCF, according to Schalatek, but "it is a matter of waiting out the Trump administration". Sareen believes we need to keep in mind the campaign rhetoric of any election."The US hasn\'t withdrawn from the UNFCCC, and its financial obligations relate to the UNFCCC so its overall commitment stays."\nClimate finance, as outlined in the UNFCCC, is more essential for small, climatically vulnerable countries than India, which is better placed to mobilise domestic resources.But climate funding needs to be more transparent if it is to continue as a credible tool to fight climate change.\n'b"The University of St. Francis issued the following news release:\nThe University of St. Francis (USF) joins 161 leaders in the U.S. Catholic community on behalf of the Catholic Climate Covenant (CCC) in delivering a letter to President Trump and Congress asking them to support a global effort to address climate change by:\n* supporting the Senate's request to provide $10 million to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change;\n* participate meaningfully in the deliberations of the UNFCCC; and\n* honor our nation's commitment to the Green Climate Fund.\nBy adding his signature to this letter, USF President Arvid C.

They allege that federal agencies haven\'t done enough to keep global warming in check--in fact, the kids argue that leasing federal property for fossil fuel extraction makes things worse. \n\nWhile the government initially filed a motion to dismiss the case, a federal judge denied the appeal. As such, the feds turned to fossil fuel industry groups to help them build their defemse. \n\nBut this week, three of those groups pulled out of the case. Why? Because they couldn\'t convincingly argue that climate change isn\'t real. \n\nThe American Petroleum Institute (API), National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) all dropped their attempts to intervene in Juliana v. U.S. They were planning to argue that a judgment requiring the government to tighten environmental regulations would harm their business interests. \n\nBut when Judge Thomas Coffin ordered the three companies to submit a joint filing outlining their views on climate change, the groups realized they didn\'t agree on what those views were. Court transcripts show they were unable to come to a consensus on the effect human activity and greenhouse gas emissions have on global warming. \n\nThis confusion is not surprising given that 97 percent of scientists agree that climate change is real, and research shows that the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased greenhouse gases. The industry groups may also fear that laying out the scientific findings they accept in court could bind them to specific positions in other climate change cases. \n\nBut in statements to the Observer, several of the groups involved said it was actually Trump\'s election which convinced them it wasn\'t necessary to take part in the case--after all, he thinks climate change is a hoax "created by and for the Chinese." \n\n"After every election, the NAM evaluates what cases we need to be involved in to protect manufacturers\' interests. The dynamics have changed over the last several months," NAM Senior Vice President and General Counsel Linda Kelly told the Observer in an email. "We fully support the efforts of the remaining defendants to push back against the plaintiffs\' ill-conceived legal theory of regulation by court decree." \n\n"Fossil fuels have enormously benefited mankind, and the plaintiffs\' proposal to eliminate them would severely harm our nation and the world," the AFPM said in a statement. "We are confident that the U.S. Department of Justice will rigorously defend its position and that the court will conclude that setting national environmental policy is the role of Congress and the president." \n\nBut while these media statements take a strong stance, the fossil fuel groups did not use the same tactic with the judicial system. In fact, the motions to withdraw didn\'t give any explanation for their exit. \n\n"What is noticeably absent from these withdrawal motions is the reason why the fossil fuel industry wants to leave the case," Phillip L. Gregory, co-lead counsel for the plaintiffs, said in a statement. "They plead with the court to let them out, yet fail to give Judge Coffin any reason behind their change of heart." \n\nPerhaps the heads of these companies finally read Laudato Si, the climate change encyclical Pope Francis presented to President Trump earlier this week. Or maybe they\'re just trying to escape like Scooby-Doo villains before they get unmasked. \n\nCredit: John Bonazzo \n'b'Americas 250 million cars, together with other modes of transport, now emit more carbon dioxide than any other segment of the U.S. - more than power plants, factories or households. The fuel efficiency regulations adopted in 2014 represented the single biggest step any country has taken to fight climate change.\nWe have seen the auto industry adapt to these regulations. Clean cars standards cut carbon pollution from cars and trucks, cleaning up our air and helping to combat climate change. The auto industry is strong and sales are good. The waiting list for electric cars is years long.\nSadly, President Trump has shown an alarming willingness to dismantle protections against dangerous pollution and climate change. His administration has signaled a review and intent to weaken standards.\nSadly, heres another big mistake by the Trump administration. Americans will suffer: 24 million Americans, including 6.3 million children, suffer from asthma. Rolling back fuel efficiency and clean cars standards will only increase pollution, triggering more asthma attacks and other negative public health impacts like respiratory diseases.\nRisking the health of hardworking Americans - and their children - is unacceptable. We need to keep moving forward with these standards, not slam the brakes on them.\n\nMary LaPorte,\n\n\nMissoula\n\n'b'Kathmandu, March 19: The fifth National Youth Conference on Climate Change began today in Bhaktapur with the theme "Empowering youth for resilient tomorrow".\nAs many as 70 youths representing 35 districts of Nepal are participating in the conference.

Climate change is unstoppable. Climate solutions provide opportunities that are unmatchable."\nOfficials from other countries joined the chorus of critics. Swedish Climate Minister Isabella Lovin called Trump\'s expected decision "contrary to what we expect from the U.S. leadership when humanity faces major challenges."\nTrump insisted he hadn\'t made a final decision on the issue up through Wednesday afternoon, even though he\'d railed against the agreement during the campaign and vowed to back out of it.\nHe\'s similarly wavered about withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement, and his pledge to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer did not confirm or deny the reports, and told the press "when the President has a decision to make, he\'ll let it be known."\nUnder the terms of the deal, the United States could not completely withdraw until November 2020, near the end of Trump\'s first term.

At the time, Obama called it "the best possible shot to save the one planet we\'ve got."\nBut Trump, who once called global warming "a hoax" perpetrated by the Chinese government, signaled soon after his election that he would reverse course.\nWhen he met with allied nations at the G-7 summit in Sicily last week, he was the only leader to withhold support for the Paris deal, while all others vocally supported it.\nTrump\'s hesitance cast a pall over the summit, leaving leaders like German Chancellor Angela Merkel publicly questioning Europe\'s reliance on the United States. A United States exit would cause devastating damage to the Paris accord.\nCredit: BY JASON SILVERSTEIN NEW YORK DAILY NEWS With Christopher Brennan\n'b"Most people understand that human-caused climate change is a real and serious threat. True, some still reject the mountains of evidence amassed by scientists from around the world over many decades, and accepted by every legitimate scientific academy and institution. But as the physical evidence builds daily - from increasingly frequent and intense extreme weather events like droughts and floods to disappearing polar ice to rising sea levels - it takes an incredible amount of denial to claim we have no reason to worry.\nClimate change isn't an easy or pleasant subject, and massive efforts by the fossil fuel industry and its supporters to sow doubt and confusion have made it harder for people to grasp. With all the information out there, it's not always easy to distinguish between analysis based on rational, peer-reviewed evidence and propaganda from industry and deniers. But if more people truly understood the enormity of the crisis, we'd be engaged in an all-out effort, comparable to those undertaken during world wars, to reduce the threat.\nThat's why David Suzuki Foundation senior editor Ian Hanington and I wrote Just Cool It!: The Climate Crisis and What We Can Do. The book provides a clear and comprehensive overview of global warming, climate science and solutions. We examine the science's history, from 1824 when natural philosopher Joseph Fourier discovered the greenhouse effect - although he didn't call it that - through to the discovery of feedback loops, and up to the present, following the 2015 Paris Agreement, which was based on the current evidence outlined in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report.\nThe book then delves into climate consequences and impacts - from extreme weather to melting Arctic ice and ocean acidification to species extinction and impacts on human physical and mental health to the refugee crisis and more.\nWith extensive knowledge about climate change and its consequences and impacts, one has to ask why we're moving so slowly to confront such an urgent problem. We're already in a troubling state and it will quickly get worse if we fail to tackle it head-on. The book's next section explores some reasons behind this lack of resolve. Although there's progress in many areas, we still have to come to terms with outmoded ways of thinking and living that prevent us from acting in our own best interests. We also have to deal with issues like population growth and industrialization in the developing world. And we're still up against wealthy, powerful interests that would like us to ignore the issue so they can continue to reap enormous fossil fuel profits.\nDespite the barriers, there's a wide range of solutions, and most of the book focuses on those. Some are already in place and some are being developed. Some show more promise than others, and some have their own pitfalls. Ultimately, though, this is what gives us hope. As we point out, no single technology, action or idea will get us out of this mess. It will take concerted efforts from individuals, governments at all levels and people in every sector, from agriculture to science and technology.\nThe benefits of many solutions go beyond their climate implications. Burning less coal, oil and gas helps the climate but also cuts pollution, which protects human health and brings health-care costs down. Those who are able to walk, bike or take transit instead of driving will improve their physical and mental health (avoiding gridlock aggravation, for example) and save significant amounts of money. Improving agricultural methods can increase the carbon stored in soils and plants and prevent loss of fertile soils, which is also a serious problem for humanity.\nMany individual solutions, especially, come with added benefits. There's so much people can do in their personal lives: drive less, eat less or no meat and dairy, be more energy efficient, reduce waste, buy less and divest from fossil fuel companies among them. But individual actions alone won't resolve the crisis. That's why the most important way to help keep the world healthy and habitable for humans is to get informed and get involved. We hope this book will encourage more people to join the growing movement for a livable future!\nDavid Suzukiis a scientist, broadcaster, author and co-founder of the David Suzuki Foundation.

The Government has also agreed to support developing countries through sharing information and expertise around our Irish Aid programmes. I am looking forward to representing Ireland at the High Level Segment of COP 23 in Bonn this week. This year\'s Conference is a crucial milestone on the journey to full implementation of the Paris Agreement. To underpin Ireland\'s commitment to full implementation the additional allocation will support a range of initiatives for international climate action."\nIreland will provide additional financial support to the Green Climate Fund and the Adaptation Fund of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change as well as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The Green Climate Fund and the Adaptation Fund are the key funding mechanisms of the UNFCCC providing financial assistance for mitigation and adaptation projects in developing countries.\nIreland will also provide financial support to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2017. The IPCC is the international body assessing the science related to climate change. It was set up to provide policymakers with mitigation options and regular assessments of the scientific basis of climate change, its impacts and future risks. Its reports underpin the development of international climate policy under the UNFCCC, including the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement.\nThe Minister also announced that the Government has agreed to his proposal for Ireland to join the NDC Partnership. Minister Naughten commented:\n"Membership of the NDC Partnership will reinforce and help to amplify Ireland\'s commitment to developing countries by assisting these countries in areas where Ireland has particular expertise, such as the delivery of Irish Aid programmes."\nMinister Naughten also confirmed that he secured Cabinet approval to bring a motion to Dail Eireann to ratify the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. This will result in the phasing out of HFC gases (hydro fluorocarbons) used in refrigeration and air-conditioning units which significantly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. The phasing out of HFCs would avoid 0.5 degrees Celsius of  global warming.\nThe Minister added that our national procedures to ratify the Amendment will be completed by the end of the year. Ireland and the EU have been at the forefront of negotiating the amendment. The EU has agreed to ratify in its own right and is awaiting Member States\' national ratifications.\nRatification by Ireland is a clear signal of our commitment to playing our part in tackling global climate change.\nThis document was posted showing the date: Nov. 14, 2017\nMSTRUCK-6074686 MSTRUCK\n'b'As western Montana and many other parts of the West burn in a desiccating season that is one major wind event away from a repeat of the 1910 Great Burn, that smell in the air from forests cremated into micro soot is the stink of human-caused climate change denial.\nWhen U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, U.S. Rep. Greg Gianforte and Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke - Montanans, Republicans and climate change deniers one and all - recently, and cynically, used the nearby Lolo Peak fire as a photo opportunity to blame environmentalists and their lawsuits for the fires, I thought, O Lord, wheres a load of slurry when you need one?\nIf they could blame environmentalists for super hurricanes Harvey and Irma and what other horrors the Atlantic storm season will bring, surely they would.\nDont you know? The 270,000-acre fire in eastern Montana this summer was because environmentalists wouldnt let the feds cut more grass.\nThe Great Burn of 1910 - little environmentalism but lots of logging. What mattered was nature - prolonged heat and drought followed by a cold front with extreme winds that whipped widespread fires into a wall of flame. Climate change makes the first two conditions much more prevalent, as we are seeing this year. Climate change makes super hurricanes much more prevalent, with unusually warm water in the seas feeding the storms.\nIn Montana, 1 million acres burned. 1,700 fires. Unhealthy to hazardous smoke choking the valleys in which we live. A total cost well over $220 million and counting. What is the cost to tourism? To the health of our lungs?\nAnd this is just Montana, as nine Western states battle drought and fires.\n2014, 2015, 2016. Each year a new record for global surface temperatures, with 2017 on track to be at least the second-hottest. A steady rise in temperature, decade after decade since the 1970s, matching the steady rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide, released by humans, now over 400 ppm.\nBut you wont hear a peep of concern from our Republican representatives and the Republican president of the United States, who cheeps climate change is a Chinese hoax. Whether glib or plain stupid, what they are saying by their inaction is that they dont take the lives of Montanans, the lives of Americans and lives across the globe seriously. What matters to them is money, business as usual and votes, and who can blame the near half of America that denies climate change and casts their votes accordingly, when they are misled by politicians who dont care about science, or pretend they dont.\nBy not taking what climate scientists have been telling us for decades seriously, by not educating themselves on the science of climate change, our politicians are not taking our lives seriously, nor our childrens lives, nor the lives of generations to come. And they mislead their electorate into voting for carriers of the staff of ignorance.\nHeres a place to start educating: coal. The stupidest use of coal is to dig up all that carbon reserve stripped from the atmosphere, burn it and release that carbon back into our atmosphere to warm the Earth. And then cynically defend "business as usual" by denying climate change exists and merely crying Jobs! The unremitting pumping of carbon into our atmosphere "leads" us towards a global future of unnecessary suffering, conflict and death.\nClimate change will educate us that the 2010s are a mere prelude to the devastation to come.\nZinke, Daines, Gianforte: you and so many others fiddle away while the world burns.\n'b'As per the fifth Assessment report (AR5) of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published in 2014, globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature has risen by 0.85 0C (0.65 to 1.06) over the period 1880 to 2012. Many extreme weather and climate events like heat waves, heavy precipitation and tropical cyclones have been observed since about 1950.\n According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), in line with rising temperatures across the globe, all India mean temperatures have risen nearly 0.60 C over the last 110 years. Further IMD studies have highlighted that extreme events like heat waves have risen in the last 30 years. Similarly, trends in extreme rainfall events in last century showed significant positive trend over the west coast and north western parts of peninsula.\n The Government has launched the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) in June 2008 to deal with the climate change and related issues. NAPCC comprises of eight Missions in specific areas of solar energy, enhanced energy efficiency, habitat, water, sustaining Himalayan ecosystems, forestry, agriculture and strategic knowledge for climate change, which addresses the issues relating to mitigation of greenhouse gases and adaptation to the adverse impacts of climate change on environment, forests, habitat, water resources and agriculture. All States and Union Territories (UTs) have also been requested to prepare State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) in line with the objectives of the NAPCC highlighting state specific issues relating to climate change. So far, 32 States and UTs have prepared their SAPCC.\n India ratified the Paris Agreement to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on 2.10.2016 which involves implementation of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted by India to the UNFCCC. India has committed to reduce Green House Gas (GHG) emissions intensity of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 33 to 35 percent by 2030 from 2005 level. Other quantified goals are (a) to achieve about 40 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy resources by 2030 with the help of transfer of technology and low cost international finance including from Green Climate Fund (GCF), (b) to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. To better adapt to climate change by enhancing investment in development programmes in sectors vulnerable to climate change, particularly agriculture, water resources, Himalayan region, coastal regions, health and disaster management.\n This information was given by Minister of State (Independent Charge) of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Anil Madhav Dave, in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.\n (Press Information Bureau, Government of India)\n'b'The top scientists from Australia and China are teaming up to tackle climate change, says Peter Boyer\nCSIRO is back in town and back on the world climate research stage. That was the real news in yesterday\'s welcome announcement of a new Hobart-based Centre for Southern Hemisphere Oceans Research.\nThe centre, which has the nifty acronym CSHOR (seashore), is financially supported by China\'s largest marine science research institute, Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (QNLM).\nThe full funding commitment for CSHOR is $20 million over 10 years, half of which will come from China. Two Australian universities, Tasmania and New South Wales, are also contributors, offering shared facilities and personnel.\nThe funding is modest, but the important point is the international connection, which will offer some protection against any further CSIRO funding cuts.\nThis is just what was needed after CSIRO\'s decision early last year to cut climate research resources on grounds that it needed those resources to respond to a government drive for commercially-driven science.\nWithin a week of the decision\'s announcement, thousands of climate scientists from around the world had put their names to a letter to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, pointing out the critical importance of CSIRO\'s multi-decadal investigation of Southern Hemisphere climate.\nAt the same time, some senior CSIRO scientists were questioning their board and chief executive, Larry Marshall, over declining to put in a submission on Australian climate policy. One of those scientists was world-leading sea level specialist John Church, who was sacked last May.\nThere was an immediate outcry over the sacking. Responding to the bad press, new science minister Greg Hunt issued a statement that "public good" research into climate change was here to stay.\nExtra money was found and plans put together, and in March this year senior CSIRO atmospheric scientist Helen Cleugh took charge of a rebadged CSIRO climate research program, in which remaining climate scientists and programs came together in a new Climate Change Centre.\nKey to the development of both CSHOR and the parent Climate Change Centre has been ocean scientist Steve Rintoul, whose long CSIRO career is approaching 30 years. He doesn\'t talk about it, but my judgment is that he was an important steadying influence through some troubled times.\nIt will be fascinating to see how CSHOR\'s Chinese connection develops over time. Qingdao, on the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula roughly halfway between Beijing and Shanghai, is a major Chinese port city with a long maritime history.\nQNLM is a brand-new institution being installed there by national, provincial and city governments. The aim is to make it a world-leading marine science institution, and given its financial and other resources (its workforce is already as big as CSIRO\'s) that seems very likely.\nThe blend of QNLM resources and CSIRO\'s decades of marine science experience looks propitious for both institutions. China is investing heavily in doing marine science, and CSHOR offers it a lot of hard-earned knowledge about ocean processes in southern regions.\nCSHOR is a recognition by both governments of the fundamental importance of the global ocean, which covers more than 70 per cent of Earth\'s surface, in Earth\'s climate system. It takes up a quarter of our excess carbon dioxide from the air and over 90 per cent of excess heat energy.\nMost of the world\'s ocean waters are in the Southern Hemisphere, where fierce westerly winds drive huge currents which power the world\'s ocean circulation. For marine scientists, the global action is here.\nBoth China and Australia are directly affected by two climate processes: the El Nino -- Southern Oscillation, originating in the tropical Pacific, and an Indian Ocean phenomenon known as the Indian Ocean Dipole. These will be a key focus of the new centre\'s work.\nIn announcing the initiative yesterday, Larry Marshall said CSHOR would study the oceans from the tropics (including Northern Hemisphere tropics) to Antarctica and "tackle fundamental questions about the future climate of Australia, China and the rest of the world." He described the Chinese involvement as an "exciting opportunity", a sentiment shared by QNLM director Professor Lixin Wu, who said he looked forward to working with CSIRO "in helping China, Australia and the rest of the world to better tackle and adjust to climate changes." It\'s a relief to hear such positive sentiments from Larry Marshall. Sixteen months ago he said CSIRO would now focus on "delivering outcomes" because the question of climate change was "definitively answered" -- a very unscientific response to the most complex science of all.\nAny student of the scientific method will tell you that science is driven by questions and the testing of those questions against evidence, and cannot give definitive answers. It is slowly opening our eyes to the vast, intricate Earth system, but the process can never be complete.\nMarshall said back then that CSIRO\'s climate measurers and modellers "might not be the right people to figure out how to adapt [to climate]". But without good data and well-constructed, evolving models, planned adaptation will be impossible. We\'ll be flying blind.\nBut if the CSIRO board and chief executive slipped up, big institutions have ways of sorting these things out. Like the Earth system, CSIRO is a complex beast with a long history of multi-tasking.\nWhile Marshall\'s digital innovation program ramps up -- and good luck to it -- the arrival of the Climate Science Centre and CSHOR seems just what\'s needed to put CSIRO back in its world-leading position in Southern Hemisphere climate science.\nAnother positive development: as it happens, the two Australian universities supporting CSHOR (NSW and Tasmania) have both engaged the expert services of John Church. So maybe, after all the trauma of 2016, things might turn out better than ever.

It\'s because of fear that they are losing jobs and economy and the Trump administration is fueled by greed and an indifference to the impact of oil and gas upon our shared planet\nThe global leaders, finally on October 5, 2016, endorsed the Paris Agreement to tackle climate change. The Paris Agreement builds upon the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and-for the first time-brings all nations into a common cause to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its effects, with enhanced support to assist developing countries to do so. The world was excited thereafter until the United States of America, under President Donald Trump\'s administration, decided to pull out itself from the Paris Agreement earlier this year.\nMeanwhile, in the autumn of 2016, the world\'s governments came together to agree on 17 ambitious sustainable development goals, which promised to overcome a vast array of problems-from poverty and hunger to health and gender equality-by 2030. But if history is a guide and a similar path is followed, these goals may be overly ambitious. An earlier set of Millennium Development Goals included one on education and stated that by 2015 all boys and girls should complete a full course of primary education. Yet fifteen years after 164 countries agreed to work towards education for all, just one-third achieved the six goals set.\nClimate change, poverty, hunger, water-shortages, lack of education, lack of health-care, gender inequity, human rights violations, war, refugee crisis, migration etc. appear to be  problems but they are actually not the problem in itself, rather they are the results caused by the root problems known as \'fear\'. Fear makes people with resources and power violent. Fear is caused by insecurity, greed, hatred and delusions. All these three greatest human defilement are caused by \'ignorance\'.\nAll these, setting targets after targets, have no meaning until we tackle the root cause of the problem. Otherwise these targets just add another bullet point to the CV of such particular leaders and give them reason to celebrate during the launch of such targets. Why is America pulling out of the Paris agreement? It\'s because of fear that they are losing jobs and economy-and the Trump administration is fueled by greed and an indifference to the impact of oil, gas upon our shared planet.\nWhy does China want to champion the Paris Agreement? In part, because they want to replace the American domination in the world stage and become the major dominant player. It is the fear of losing domination over others and fear of being dominated by others that pushes countries to increase their defense spending incrementally every year.\nAnd again, these are only the problems we are thinking about humans and human interests only. But humans cannot survive and ignore the ecosystem, environment, other species, trees and plants, rivers, mountains, valleys, forests, lakes, deserts, sea and air. Can we really think about them independent from our needs and greed? Have we seriously looked at how much forest the world has lost over the past 100 years, how much bio-diversity the world has lost and the consequences of that? How much populations of other animals, birds, fishes and other living beings have declined and shrunk to extinction over the last 100 years, so many that some scientists refer to this as the Sixth Great Extinction event. Yet the human population is exploding disproportionately.\nAs a dominant species and a being that can think when do we learn to think in ways free from fear? When do we learn to think how to overcome our fear and think about not controlling others but empowering them to be free, think about not hating others but learn how to embrace each other, think about not only \'me\'. When do we start treating our very world, our only home, with the respect and love that is essential if our species is to survive?\nAll the development approaches and setting ambitious targets have failed to recognize an important human trait that is \'imagination\'. We always "imagine" a world that is selfish and horrible until we can outgrow our \'fear\'. A sustainable development is definitely not about higher GDP growth which can be easily achieved by exploiting the poor and natural resources, using all kind of policies, techniques and technologies. A sustainable development must also not be about just human needs in a solely human-centric way, it is about the entire world and every living and non-living being-centric.\nAll these values are diluted and contaminated by corporate approaches and companies which just want to make money.\nBefore setting up further targets and development goals, may we, as the UN and world leaders and every human being develop a universal program that empowers us to overcome our "fear" as a particular individual, as a particular society, as a particular nationality, as a particular ethnicity, race, religion or geography and as a human who is perceived, accurately or not, as "superior" beings than the rest. Both fear and love are universal. How many schools, communities across the world really teaches how to overcome "fear" and how to \'love and let love\' unconditionally.\nWe often do not acknowledge that "I too have to die, sooner or later", so why become greedy and obsessed to amass wealth beyond our needs? Why not meditate and self-reflect so we can deal with existential fear.\nThink about the whole environment, other species and fellow humans before you attempt to make even a single rupee.\nCopyright 2017 Asia Pacific Communication Associates Nepal Pvt Ltd, distributed by Contify.com\nCredit: Sunil b pant\n'b'Dozens of states across the country, in addition to Canada and Europe, are experiencing record wildfires in 2017. Climate change has increased the number of wildfires, their longevity and the length of the wildfire season. Global increases in temperature during the spring and summer are causing dry areas to become even drier and snow to melt earlier, leading to drought and conditions ripe for wildfires.\nThe U.S. Forest Service has reported that 5.6 million acres of land have burned so far in the U.S. in 2017, which is 1.8 million acres over the 10 year average at the same time of year. In Florida, wildfires across the state have surpassed the five year average of acres burned from wildfires. Record high temperatures have fueled wildfires across the Western United States. Nevada reported its worst wildfire season in 15 years. Montana has also experienced one of its worst wildfire seasons ever this year, and the state is running out of funds to fight them.\nBetween January and May 2017, there were 57,585 wildfires in the U.S.-the most in that timespan since 2000. Those fires burned 2.763 million acres of land in the U.S., which is the second highest amount on record for that period of time.\nIn Canada, British Columbia has declared 2017 to be its second worst wildfire year on record. The BC Wildfire has spent $204 million fighting wildfires in nearly 5,000 square kilometers. Smoke from these fires have made the state of Washingtons air quality the worst in the United States.\nEven in cases where wildfires are caused by humans, their expansion is facilitated by environmental conditions caused by climate change: Higher temperatures throughout the year cause extremely dry conditions in which wildfires spread faster and become much more difficult to contain. In states like California, wet winters boost plant growth, creating more fuel for wildfires, which are facilitated by increasingly high summer temperatures. In this way, opposing extreme weather conditions exacerbated by climate change contribute to surges in wildfires.\nAccording to the Union of Concerned Scientists, Wildfires in the Western United States have been increasing in frequency and duration since the mid-1980s, occurring nearly four times more often, burning more than six times the land area, and lasting almost five times as long (comparisons are between 1970-1986 and 1986-2003). With more than 10 million acres burned, 2015 was worst wildfire season on record in the United States.\nDespite this troubling trend, the Trump administration has proposed slashing the budget of climate centers that provide necessary data and information to anticipate potential wildfires. Popular Science reports, Funding for the nations six Regional Climate Centers (RCCs), which provide data that we use to help control and prevent wildfires, is on the chopping block. The presidents proposed budget would slash the Centers budgets by 82 percent, from $3.65 million to $650,000. Trump has also proposed drastic cuts to the U.S. Forest Service in his 2018 budget, with a $300 million reduction in wildfire fighting programs, a $50 million cut to wildfire prevention efforts, and a 23 percent cut in budgets to volunteer firefighter departments. Trump is threatening to destroy vital resources that thousands of Americans rely on to prevent and control wildfires in the United States.\nCredit: Michael Sainato\n'b'Environment and Climate Change Canada quietly released a new report this month that shows a small decline in greenhouse gas emissions but projects Canada won\'t meet its climate targets by 2030 unless new measures are introduced. Climate experts say the report, posted online without fanfare or press release on April 13, tells a story of inertia. \n"Look around you. Look at buildings, cars, factories. There\'s your emissions," Mark Jaccard, of Simon Fraser University, said Friday. \n"I think the message out of these is, in some ways, how much inertia there is in these systems. 2014 to 2015, most of us are driving the same car, most of us are living in the same house. Most of us are working in the same jobs. The factories we have are the same," Andrew Leach, at the University of Alberta, said. "They\'re slow changes in all those pieces of the puzzle." \nCanada is supposed to submit such reports to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change every year by April 15. The UN body met in December 2015 to sign the Paris Agreement, which seeks to cap global warming at two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, while aiming, at the behest of Canada, for 1.5 C warming at most. \nThe specific Canadian target - the same one set by Stephen Harper\'s Conservative government in May 2015 - is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. \nThe Liberals, in addition to helping negotiate the Paris Agreement, launched a "Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change" last December. The main policy is a federal carbon tax floor, at $10 per tonne by next year, rising to $50 per tonne by 2022. The government is also phasing out coal, trying to set a federal clean fuel standard and pursuing other regulations. \nProjections from the department, based on those policies, predict Canada could make significant progress on emissions reductions but will still fall short of its 2030 target. To meet Canada\'s climate target in 2030, reductions would have to come from "additional measures, such as investments into public transit, green infrastructure, clean technology and innovation, stored carbon, international mechanisms," according to the report. \nGovernment data show overall emissions have gone down slightly, overall - from 727 megatonnes in 2014 to 722 megatonnes in 2015. Emissions were at 738 megatonnes in 2005, and to meet targets, they\'d have to go all the way down to 523 megatonnes by 2030. \n"Two things caused emissions to go down in the last 10 years," Jaccard said. "One was a huge recession that closed a lot of energy-intensive industries, especially in Ontario and Quebec. The second was Ontario closing its coal plants. And those are the things that are out of the ordinary." \nOil-related emissions have gone up, with Alberta showing the biggest increase in emissions in 2015. Part of that has to do with more frequent use of a technique called steam-assisted gravity drainage, Jaccard said. That technique sees oil being heated so it can be drained out of sand, and natural gas is often used for that heating. For the Liberal government to support oilsands by approving pipelines, but meet Paris targets on the other hand, is "a big disconnect," said Jaccard. It is possible to develop oilsands in an emissions-neutral way, by storing carbon in the ground. But that\'s expensive. \nWhile Jaccard believes government policies could have "significant impact" and "I would not rule out the federal government being able to achieve Paris," he said, "the proof will be in the pudding." \nA "pretty hard right turn," in a tight time frame, is now required for Canada to get to its target, Leach said, and inertia makes things challenging. "The big story here is the targets that we have on the table right now would require incredibly stringent policies to meet," he said. "I don\'t think there\'s anybody saying that the policies announced to date will get you there." \nStill, Marie-Pascale Des Rosiers, a spokeswoman for environment minister Catherine McKenna, said the government\'s framework "contains a real plan to put us on a path to meeting or exceeding Canada\'s 2030 target." The government has not announced what level of carbon pricing it intends to impose between 2022 and 2030. \nmdsmith@postmedia.com\nCredit: Marie-Danielle Smith; National Post\nRyan Jackson, Edmonton Journal / An aerial view of oilsands operations north of Fort McMurray, Alta. Oil-related emissions have risen, according to a new federal government report, with Alberta showing the biggest increase in emissions in 2015.\n'b'In expressing support for the Paris Climate Accord, Dane County officials also committed to having all county government operations generated by renewable energy sources by 2035 at the latest.\nBut the county might meet that goal way before then.\nIn 2016, Dane County paid utilities for using 35.5 million kilowatt hours of electricity while also producing 34.6 million kilowatt hours of renewable electricity from county landfills and solar energy projects, according to Dave Merritt, the county\'s Department of Administration director of policy & program development.\nWith new projects funded in the 2017 budget becoming operational, such as the east district highway garage that features 800 solar panels, the county could meet its goal 18 years early.\n"It is reasonable that county government electricity use will be offset by 100 percent renewable production in the 2017-2018 time period," Merritt said.\nIf manure digesters were included, Dane County government would be producing 170 percent of the renewable electricity it uses.\nManure digesters that the county helped develop in Middleton and Waunakee produce a combined 26 million kilowatt hours per year. However, that energy is owned by Gundersen Health System and Clean Fuel Partners, the companies that operate the digesters.\nThe County\'s Sustainability Subcommittee of the Public Works and Transportation Committee will work to set a date for county government operations to rely solely on renewable energy.\nThe Paris agreement, signed by 195 countries in 2015, establishes a commitment to take concrete measures to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming. President Donald Trump announced June 1 the United States would withdraw from the agreement.\nThe resolution signed by Dane County Executive July 17 states that the county has a responsibility to "protect and enhance the quality of life" for future generations.\n"Actions that reduce the combustion of fossil fuels and the release of greenhouse gases in Dane County, including prioritizing efficiency and transitioning to low-carbon energy sources, have the potential to improve air quality, public health, energy security, social equity, local natural environments, and quality of life for all residents," the resolution states.\nThe resolution also supports setting a similar goal beyond county government operations to include the entire community.\n"Our goal really is not to try to force anybody to do anything ... but rather to set an example," Supervisor Tim Kiefer said.\nDane County has taken strides to confront the effects of climate change. The Climate Change Council, created by Executive Joe Parisi in the 2017 budget, met for the first time Tuesday to begin developing a climate action plan that will inform how the county can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare the county for the effects of climate change.\n"With our communities constantly getting bombarded with heavy rains and 100-year floods seeming to take place every year now, the Climate Change Council could not be more timely," Parisi said in a statement. "I am eager to have the council begin its work and see what further actions Dane County can take to combat climate change and its effects that negatively impact our residents on a more and more frequent basis."\nDane County is also in the process of switching over its fleet to using compressed natural gas with the goal of having nearly all county-owned vehicles converted to compressed natural gas by 2023, Kiefer said. Some vehicles would still run on gasoline or diesel such as the sheriff\'s department\'s boat patrol, which cannot be feasibly converted to compressed natural gas.\nCredit: BY ABIGAIL BECKER\nCaption: JOHN HARTA large compactor truck crushes and moves waste last month at the Dane County landfill.

Look at buildings, cars, factories. There\'s your emissions," Mark Jaccard, of Simon Fraser University, said Friday. \n"I think the message out of these is, in some ways, how much inertia there is in these systems. 2014 to 2015, most of us are driving the same car, most of us are living in the same house. Most of us are working in the same jobs. The factories we have are the same," Andrew Leach, at the University of Alberta, said. "They\'re slow changes in all those pieces of the puzzle." \nCanada is supposed to submit such reports to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change every year by April 15. The UN body met in December 2015 to sign the Paris Agreement, which seeks to cap global warming at two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, while aiming, at the behest of Canada, for 1.5 C warming at most. \nThe specific Canadian target - the same one set by Stephen Harper\'s Conservative government in May 2015 - is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. \nThe Liberals, in addition to helping negotiate the Paris Agreement, launched a "Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change" last December. The main policy is a federal carbon tax floor, at $10 per tonne by next year, rising to $50 per tonne by 2022. The government is also phasing out coal, trying to set a federal clean fuel standard and pursuing other regulations. \nProjections from the department, based on those policies, predict Canada could make significant progress on emissions reductions but will still fall short of its 2030 target. To meet Canada\'s climate target in 2030, reductions would have to come from "additional measures, such as investments into public transit, green infrastructure, clean technology and innovation, stored carbon, international mechanisms," according to the report. \nGovernment data show overall emissions have gone down slightly, overall - from 727 megatonnes in 2014 to 722 megatonnes in 2015. Emissions were at 738 megatonnes in 2005, and to meet targets, they\'d have to go all the way down to 523 megatonnes by 2030. \n"Two things caused emissions to go down in the last 10 years," Jaccard said. "One was a huge recession that closed a lot of energy-intensive industries, especially in Ontario and Quebec. The second was Ontario closing its coal plants. And those are the things that are out of the ordinary." \nOil-related emissions have gone up, with Alberta showing the biggest increase in emissions in 2015. Part of that has to do with more frequent use of a technique called steam-assisted gravity drainage, Jaccard said. That technique sees oil being heated so it can be drained out of sand, and natural gas is often used for that heating. For the Liberal government to support oilsands by approving pipelines, but meet Paris targets on the other hand, is "a big disconnect," said Jaccard. It is possible to develop oilsands in an emissions-neutral way, by storing carbon in the ground. But that\'s expensive. \nWhile Jaccard believes government policies could have "significant impact" and "I would not rule out the federal government being able to achieve Paris," he said, "the proof will be in the pudding." \nA "pretty hard right turn," in a tight time frame, is now required for Canada to get to its target, Leach said, and inertia makes things challenging. "The big story here is the targets that we have on the table right now would require incredibly stringent policies to meet," he said. "I don\'t think there\'s anybody saying that the policies announced to date will get you there." \nStill, Marie-Pascale Des Rosiers, a spokeswoman for environment minister Catherine McKenna, said the government\'s framework "contains a real plan to put us on a path to meeting or exceeding Canada\'s 2030 target." The government has not announced what level of carbon pricing it intends to impose between 2022 and 2030. \nCanada is one of 143 parties, out of 197 in total, that have ratified the Paris Agreement. On Thursday, Canada also joined an "Under2 Coalition" focused on the two-degree target, which includes France, Germany, the United Kingdom and others. \nNational Post mdsmith@postmedia.com\nCredit: Marie-Danielle Smith; Edmonton Journal\nRyan Jackson, Edmonton Journal / An aerial view of oilsands operations north of Fort McMurray, Alta.

John Jenkins signed a letter to President Donald Trump and members of the U.S. Congress addressing the issue of climate change, the University announced Thursday via a Catholic Climate Covenant press release.\nThe letter, which was signed by the leaders of more than 150 Catholic organizations, urged Trump to reassert U.S. leadership in the global effort to address climate change, an issue that has gained prominence in the Catholic Church.\nCatholic leaders across the nation and world have explicitly and consistently affirmed climate change as a moral issue that threatens core Catholic commitments, the letter said.\nSignees asked Trump to fund the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , meaningfully participate inUNFCCC business and respect the existing U.S. commitments to the Green Climate Fund. \n'b'Avila University issued the following news:\nAvila University has joined with leaders of 161 Catholic communities in every state of the nation, in issuing a letter to President Trump and the U.S. Congress in support of climate change science, funding and international policy negotiations. The letter was organized by Catholic Climate Covenant and signed by Catholic colleges and universities, religious congregations, national organizations, and health care providers.\n"This letter demonstrates a broad, unified Catholic desire for American leadership on climate change" said Most Rev. Richard Pates, Bishop of Des Moines and United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB)-appointed Liaison to Catholic Climate Covenant. "Catholic concern for climate change as a moral issue goes back to Pope John Paul II. Faithful to the Church\'s consistent teaching, Catholics in the United States will tirelessly urge our elected leaders to address one of the most pressing modern issues."\nIn the letter, Catholic leaders outline the Church\'s longstanding commitment to care for creation and reiterate the U.S. bishops\' counsel to act on widely-accepted climate change science. The leaders then collectively urge President Trump and members of the U.S. Congress to take three specific actions:\n* Fund the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC);\n* Meaningfully participate in the deliberations of the UNFCCC; and\n* Honor U.S. Commitments to the Green Climate Fund\nIn signing onto the letter, Fred P. Pestello, Ph.D., President of Saint Louis University, said: "The issue of climate change should be as much of an institution-wide responsibility as living our mission. Answering Pope Francis\'s compelling call in Laudato Si\' to be better stewards of creation is more than a papal request. It is a requisite response to living our Catholic values. Humanity must reconcile the ways in which we have not upheld the dignity of creation. Saint Louis University is compelled to solidarity in this journey. Many of the students studying at Catholic universities have been at the forefront of this endeavor, increasingly aware of their responsibility as co-creators. And the talented scientists at our universities have convincingly made the empirical case for substantial action, as well as the urgency of this critical challenge."\nTeresa Maya, CCVI, President of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, said: "Women religious are keenly aware of the threat climate change poses to God\'s creation, especially to those who are most vulnerable. We believe that we are called to live in right relationship with all of creation and we know that each of us has a responsibility to cooperate with God to protect our common home. We call on President Trump, members of Congress, and all Americans to work together to address the existential threat of climate change."\nJames F. Ennis, Executive Director of Catholic Rural Life, said: "Working with farmers and ranchers across the US, Catholic Rural Life has seen and heard the challenges facing agriculture due to the changing climate in many regions. Men and women and families living in rural communities, many of whom make their living off of the land or sea, are extremely concerned and vulnerable to changes in climate. That is why Catholic Rural Life is joining other Catholic organizations to urge President Trump and Congress to reassert U.S. leadership in the global effort to address climate change."\nFor more information: jose@catholicclimatecovenant.org; 202-756-5545;  Climate Covenant inspires and equips Catholic people and communities to care for creation and care for the poor.

The injured were admitted at Marondera Hospital.\nClimate change has negatively affected children and observers note that the unavailability of funds to rectify problems each time disasters struck has worsened the situation.\n"There is need for a fund in cases of such disasters. The lightning incident is a good case study of how the tragedy can affect pupils. We have some children who had their uniforms burnt while other lost books. Their poor parents will struggle to replace these uniforms and books," said Morgan Jaji (47), a villager who visited the lightning-hit school near Marondera.\nThe Chinatsa School incident is one of the many cases whereby children are left stranded by effects of climate change. The country was recently struck by a downgraded Cyclone Dineo-induced incessant rains that left a trail of destruction by floods.\nA number of children were killed, marooned and injured while schools were destroyed, thereby, jeopardising their future.\nAt the peak of the tropical storm that ravaged the southern parts of the country, about 270 pupils and 23 staffers at Mwenezi\'s Lundi High School were to be rescued by the military after water threatened to fill their hostels as the nearby Runde River was filled to capacity.\nZimbabwe National Council for the Welfare of Children programmes officer Maxim Murungweni said the establishment of a children\'s fund is a noble idea.\n"Firstly, we need to raise awareness and sensitise policymakers, communities and citizens in general on the negative effects of climate change on children. For example, the current destruction of school infrastructure by the cyclone, displacement of children and so on should push us to think about children\'s fund," he said.\n"There is need for a national child friendly budget that takes into consideration children\'s emergency responses to respond to children\'s needs in terms of disaster."\nMurungweni added that the new school curriculum should include climate change as a stand-alone subject.\nHe, however, stressed the importance of setting up a special children fund to deal with the effects of climate change on children. "This is a noble idea and it will ensure that there is available funds meant to address effects of climate change on children as well as child protection needs in times of disaster are often overlooked. It will also help ensure that there are skilled personnel on child protection responses in emergencies needs," he said.\nDespite the current incessant rains, Zimbabwe is just coming out of an El Nino-induced drought that saw thousands of children suffering from food and water shortages.\nWeather-related disasters such as floods, droughts, cyclones and hurricanes, which have increased in frequency and intensity as a result of climate change, have directly affected estimated 66,5 million children worldwide. About 600 000 children died between 1990 and 2000.\nThe number of children affected is tipped to double to 175 million a year in the next decade.\nAccording to World Health Organisation, climate change could be causing more than 150 000 deaths annually. These estimates could be more than double by 2030 in the absence of meaningful action.\nAccording to experts, climate change-induced extreme weather phenomena did not only impact on children\'s physical health, but it left lasting and permanent mental and emotional scars, particularly on rural children.\nClimate change communicator Peter Makwanya said rural-based children needed attention and should be considered first in policy making.\nHe said children displaced due to climate change-related flooding are then deprived of education and health facilities, as these are also affected by flooding.\n"Rural children are prime vulnerable groups without the power to influence their national climate policies.\nTherefore, there is need to accommodate rural children in the climate change discourse, as they are uniquely affected. Responsible authorities should create enabling environments that support children\'s participation in issues of climate protection and literacy," he said.\nMakwanya said that children in the disaster-prone areas need to be educated in case of emergencies.\n"Rural children in low-lying communities need sustainable climate knowledge in order to help strengthen their communities\' infrastructure, disaster risk reduction and community early warning systems. Rural children have suffered from climate injustice not only from their local communities but from governments as well," he said.\n"This is because it is the government\'s duty to meet the children\'s needs, it is the government\'s obligation to protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations."\nUnited Nations International Children\'s Emergency Fund chief of communications, Victor Chinyama said apart from a special fund there was also need to strengthen engagement of young people in actions related to climate change.\n"There is need to help develop more ambitious programmes that protect children from the impacts of climate change, and to strengthen engagement of young people in actions related to climate change," he said.\n"Also to be considered is climate-change adaptation through resilient development - including support for programmes that support children and their families to overcome disasters and reduce the risk posed by these before they happen. Examples are aquifer-recharge systems that capture water during the monsoon season, purifies it and stores it underground for use when there is scarcity; cyclone and flood proof schools; and strengthening early warning systems for extreme climate event."\nMeanwhile a local organisation Scholar Care has come up with a scheme meant to assist pupils in time of need especially on healthy situations.\nThe organisation\'s team recently donated various goods to the families of the two boys who were fatally struck by lightning at Chinatsa Secondary School.\nScholar Care marketing executive officer, Timothy Jonga said they were driven by the passion to assist with health insurance to pupils in schools countrywide.\n"We are offering health insurance to school kids, with each pupil being urged to register with us to be able to get the benefits of being treated from our health service providers. The scheme is a personal accident and sickness cover, be it early childhood education, primary and secondary pupils," he said.\n"Drowning, weather-related injuries, poisoning, injuries during sporting activities are indeed affecting the pupils and hence we are saying there is need to be ready for such untimely incidences. In general we are offering complete solution for schools in times of crisis and medical emergencies."\nScholar Care provides up to $3 000 medical cover, $500 disability assistance and $500 funeral assistance costs to an affected pupil. However, parents are to part with either $3, $6 and $10 per term for each pupil depending on the preferred cover.\n Copyright 2017 NewsDay. All Rights Reserved. Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

Thirty-six of the dozens of standards require students to understand how the climate system works.\nAs envisioned in the Climate Science Education Initiative, students would not be told the causes of climate change. Instead, they would learn to raise their own questions and study data in search of answers.\n"They will look at facts relevant to those questions and draw conclusions that answer their questions," Ted Neal, a University of Iowa clinical science instructor, told IowaWatch.\nAnd what if students look at their scientific data and then conclude that humans have not been the primary causes of climate change in the past century?\n"That is not possible," Neal answered. "Because the data is so overwhelming. Out of 920 peer-reviewed journal articles on this issue, zero found that climate change was not anthropogenic."\nHere\'s how Kris Kilibarda, the science consultant for the Iowa Department of Education, answered the same question during a telephone interview:\n"The standard requires a student to be able to create a scientific argument, and it doesn\'t say what that argument could be." She said teachers could encourage the student to "grapple with issues and engage in scientific debate with another." She said local control comes into play.\nAlthough almost all scientists agree on human activity\'s impact on climate change, many politicians and teachers still oppose teaching that in school. Some of the skeptics claim it is "only a theory" and not a fact, as if it was only a hunch.\nIn the scientific community, such statements erroneously conflate hypotheses, which are tentative but untested ideas or predictions about why something happens, with facts and evidence, which are things that can be observed or measured, and with scientific theory, which is the tested and confirmed explanation for the things that have been observed or measured.\nConsider gravity, for example, Neal suggested.\n"No matter how many times I hold this pencil in the air and release it, it will drop to the table," he said, letting the pencil fall repeatedly for emphasis. That falling pencil was an observable fact, and aspects of that fall can be measured.\nBut here\'s what\'s missing from the fact of the falling pencil: Why did it fall rather than float?\nIsaac Newton answered that question with a law of universal gravitation, said Scott Spak, a University of Iowa assistant professor of environmental and chemical engineering and urban and regional planning. Albert Einstein then developed a more complete and compelling theory to answer that question in 1915 when he developed the general theory of relativity. After rigorous research, experiments and tests that sought to disprove it, the theory of gravity became the only valid scientific explanation of the observable fact that things fall if released. That theory remains unquestioned today.\nIn climate science, the idea that human activity has been the main cause of climate change for the past century goes back several decades and subjected to repeated verification tests and experiments. Like the scientific theory that gravity makes things fall instead of float, the human-cause explanation for climate change has held up, earning it the status of scientific theory. In the scientific community, that question\'s been settled since the 1980s and was coming out in peer-reviewed journals, Spak said.\nIn 2009, 18 scientific associations issued a statement on climate change to Congress saying: "Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver."\nNevertheless, Neal, one of the leaders of the Climate Science Education Initiative, believes that merely explaining to students what scientists say is not as effective as an "inquiry-driven" approach to teaching.\nHe said "evidence-based best practices" is at the heart of K-12 Initiative, which has involved meetings and surveying public school teachers. The Initiative and the new science standards are less focused on memorizing facts and more focused on teaching students to apply the scientific process, use and analyze data and the build rational arguments to answer their own questions.\nThe climate science initiative will provide what Iowa teachers requested in a fall 2016 survey: access to observations and data, help aligning lesson plans and materials with climate science education and the Next Generation Science Standards.\nThose standards set expectations in four major scientific domains: physical science, which involves motion, force, and energy; life science, which includes ecosystems, natural selection and organisms; earth and space science; and engineering and technology. Within those domains, "students will engage in investigational learning about climate change," according to a description of the initiative on the center\'s website.\n"We\'re saying here\'s evidence, here\'s how you determine if the evidence is valid, and here\'s how you develop a scientific argument," Kilibarda, the state education department consultant, said. "You determine what the argument would be. We would never say there\'s only one way it can be, but we will say here\'s the scientific evidence."\nThe Center for Global and Environmental Research became concerned about climate science teaching in high school after IowaWatch published an article in April 2016 on how on how teachers teach it, according to University of Iowa Professors Jerald Schnoor and Greg Carmichael, the center\'s co-directors.\nNearly half the teachers surveyed for that story, reported in a collaboration with the student-run Cedar Falls High School Tiger Hi-Line newspaper, said climate change should be taught as just one theory, informing students that a variety of thought exists but without concluding which theory is right or wrong.\n"It got us thinking," said Carmichael, a chemical and biochemical engineer who has done extensive research on air quality and its environmental impacts. "That started the conversation."\nThe IowaWatch/Tiger Hi-Line article reported its findings were consistent with a national study in Science that found 30 percent of middle and high school science teachers taught global warming is probably the result of natural causes.\nSchnoor, a professor of civil and environmental engineering, said the article showed that teachers "were seemingly adrift" on how to teach climate science.\nAfter the IowaWatch/Tiger Hi-Line article, the center funded two research assistants to work on the K-12 Climate Science Education Initiative with the College of Education. To find out what was needed in class, the initiative surveyed 400 teachers and educators last fall.\nThe center, a state-funded institute, promotes research on global environmental change. Its focus includes "regional effects on natural ecosystems, environments, and resources, and effects on health, culture and social systems," the center\'s website said.\nSpak, who studies the intersection between human activity and environmental change, said that while teachers have some science expertise, they need help in climate science.\nThe survey showed that less than 25 percent of the responding teachers had been exposed to climate science at the undergraduate level.\nThey also want scientific observations, professional development and training in the content, models, and lesson plans developed by Iowa experts to use with the Next Generation Science Standards.\nThe initiative team works with public school teachers and is focusing initially on teaching tools for the eighth-grade Iowa science standards. Next it will expand to the sixth and seventh grades and finally into high school.\nNeal explained to the center\'s board in an April meeting an eighth-grade pilot being developed called "How Iowans Use Their Land." The description he distributed said the four-to-eight-week pilot will draw from nine of the 25 eighth-grade standards in the Next Generation Science Standards. For example, one of those nine requires students to "develop a model to describe the cycling of water through the earth\'s systems driven by energy from the sun and the force of gravity."\nThe class would use scientific principles to create a method for "monitoring and minimizing a human impact on the environment." Students would engage in their local environment by identifying land use changes and components of the watershed and then investigate their own questions about land use in their area, such as use of tiling for agricultural drainage or soil erosion.\nUltimately, students will learn how Iowans\' past and current actions "have impacted the region where they work and play," the description states.\nThe Next Generation Science Standards will not become mandatory for another few years, but some teachers are already trying to teach from them, according to a statement on the environmental research center\'s website.\n"One of the nice things about Iowa and Iowa teachers is that they care so much they\'re trying to get ahead the game," Neal said in a quotation attributed to him in the statement. "They\'re not looking at this with apprehension."\nThis story was produced by the Iowa Center for Public Affairs Journalism-IowaWatch.org, a non-profit, online news Website that collaborates with Iowa news organizations to produce explanatory and investigative reporting.

Further, this is the first time since 2010 that three hurricanes-Irma, Katia and Jose-have been active in the Atlantic Basin. The characteristics of the hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean this year affirm the risks associated with climate change; global warming results in the development of stronger, more intense hurricanes.\nHurricanes derive their energy from heat released from the evaporation of warm ocean water. The warmer the ocean surface, the more energy there is to develop and intensify these storms, Dr. Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State, told the Observer. Mann recently appeared in Before the Flood, Leonardo DiCaprios documentary on climate change. He continued, There is scientific consensus now that the strongest hurricanes will get stronger as the worlds oceans warm, at a rate of roughly 10 miles per hour for each degree Fahrenheit of warming. The past few years have been the warmest years on record for the worlds oceans, and it isnt a coincidence that over this time frame weve seen the strongest storms ever, as measured by peak sustained wind speeds, for the globe, the Northern Hemisphere, Southern Hemisphere, Pacific, and now with Irma, the open Atlantic.\nDr. Mann stated that the frequency of hurricanes this season isnt as much cause for alarm as their rapid intensification. Harvey was the wettest storm on record in the U.S. as a result, in part, of very warm Gulf ocean surface temperatures, which meant there was more moisture in the atmosphere available to be turned into record flooding rainfall. And Irma is now the longest-lived category 5 storm in history for the Atlantic. That is due to the very favorable environment it has found in the form of very warm ocean surface temperatures, he said. The impacts of climate change are no longer subtle. We see them playing out in real time, and this last couple weeks is a stunning example of that.\nDespite this obvious evidence of climate change, climate change skeptics and deniers have continued to argue that there is no scientific evidence proving climate change. Several evangelical Christian leaders in Texas blamed Hurricane Harvey on gay people, and conservative outlets like Breitbart pushed editorials denying the link between hurricane intensification and climate change.\nDr. Mann explained, Well, first of all, many of those who call themselves climate change skeptics are actually the opposite. All good scientists are skeptics, demanding logic and evidence, which must be all the more compelling the more extraordinary the claim. But those who reject overwhelmingly established science-like the fact that human activity is warming the planet and changing the climate-based on the flimsiest of arguments that dont stand up to the slightest bit of scrutiny are not skeptic. They are contrarians or, in many cases, simply deniers of established science. But with regard to the specific subject of these recent hurricanes, the science is very clear on the basics: Warmer oceans mean stronger storms, more flooding rains, and global sea level rise has worsened every storm surge. To deny these facts is literally to deny basic physical science.\nCredit: Chelsea Skojec\n'b"Most people understand that human-caused climate change is a real and serious threat. True, some still reject the mountains of evidence amassed by scientists from around the world over many decades, and accepted by every legitimate scientific academy and institution. But as the physical evidence builds daily - from increasingly frequent and intense extreme weather events like droughts and floods to disappearing polar ice to rising sea levels - it takes an incredible amount of denial to claim we have no reason to worry.\nClimate change isn't an easy or pleasant subject, and massive efforts by the fossil fuel industry and its supporters to sow doubt and confusion have made it harder for people to grasp. With all the information out there, it's not always easy to distinguish between analysis based on rational, peer-reviewed evidence and propaganda from industry and deniers. But if more people truly understood the enormity of the crisis, we'd be engaged in an all-out effort, comparable to those undertaken during world wars, to reduce the threat.\nThat's why David Suzuki Foundation senior editor Ian Hanington and I wrote Just Cool It!: The Climate Crisis and What We Can Do. The book provides a clear and comprehensive overview of global warming, climate science and solutions. We examine the science's history, from 1824 when natural philosopher Joseph Fourier discovered the greenhouse effect - although he didn't call it that - through to the discovery of feedback loops, and up to the present, following the 2015 Paris Agreement, which was based on the current evidence outlined in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report.\nThe book then delves into climate consequences and impacts - from extreme weather to melting Arctic ice and ocean acidification to species extinction and impacts on human physical and mental health to the refugee crisis and more.\nWith extensive knowledge about climate change and its consequences and impacts, one has to ask why we're moving so slowly to confront such an urgent problem. We're already in a troubling state and it will quickly get worse if we fail to tackle it head-on. The book's next section explores some reasons behind this lack of resolve. Although there's progress in many areas, we still have to come to terms with outmoded ways of thinking and living that prevent us from acting in our own best interests. We also have to deal with issues like population growth and industrialization in the developing world. And we're still up against wealthy, powerful interests that would like us to ignore the issue so they can continue to reap enormous fossil fuel profits.\nDespite the barriers, there's a wide range of solutions, and most of the book focuses on those. Some are already in place and some are being developed. Some show more promise than others, and some have their own pitfalls. Ultimately, though, this is what gives us hope. As we point out, no single technology, action or idea will get us out of this mess. It will take concerted efforts from individuals, governments at all levels and people in every sector, from agriculture to science and technology.\nThe benefits of many solutions go beyond their climate implications. Burning less coal, oil and gas helps the climate but also cuts pollution, which protects human health and brings health-care costs down. Those who are able to walk, bike or take transit instead of driving will improve their physical and mental health (avoiding gridlock aggravation, for example) and save significant amounts of money. Improving agricultural methods can increase the carbon stored in soils and plants and prevent loss of fertile soils, which is also a serious problem for humanity.\nMany individual solutions, especially, come with added benefits. There's so much people can do in their personal lives: drive less, eat less or no meat and dairy, be more energy efficient, reduce waste, buy less and divest from fossil fuel companies among them. But individual actions alone won't resolve the crisis. That's why the most important way to help keep the world healthy and habitable for humans is to get informed and get involved.

In particular, all executive orders on climate change will be formally rescinded. They have run their course, said the official, and simply dont reflect presidents priorities... We are taking a different path.\nAccording to the document:\n[bullet] The White House Center for Environmental Qualitys guidance that all agencies take climate change into account when making policy will be rescinded.\n[bullet] The EPAs Clean Power Plan, which set the first-ever national standards for carbon pollution from power plants will be frozen pending a new review.\n\n[bullet] The EPAs determination of the social cost of carbon, i.e., the value of a ton of carbon not put into the atmosphere, will be rescinded. The Office of Management and Budget will set the value instead.\n[bullet] The Department of the Interiors moratorium on new coal mining on public land will be rescinded.\n[bullet] President Obamas 2013 memorandum calling for a climate action plan will be rescinded.\n[bullet] President Obamas 2015 memorandum on climate mitigation efforts, to be conducted by multiple departments, will be rescinded.\n[bullet] Regulation of fracking will be reviewed.\n[bullet] Regulation of methane emissions at oil and gas production sites will be reviewed.\nAll these and other reversals are but the first part of the executive orders ambit. The second part is even more devastating for environmental concerns: to set a new, national policy on energy independence-in other words, energy production.\nOver the next 180 days, all agencies will be instructed to identify, and slate for repeal, any rules that serve as obstacles or impediments to domestic energy production. Those will range from environmental laws that protect caribou at the expense of oil drilling in Alaska, to safety regulations that raise the cost of fracking.\nIndeed, the order will call for reviewing any policies that burden energy production, including incidental ones like water regulations, limitations on public land use, housing rules regarding the siting of fracking and other fossil fuel extraction, and even tax policies. The whole point of a six-month-long, government-wide review is explicitly to change all relevant government actions to benefit energy production.\nHow best to understand this broad executive order?\nFirst, this should not be a surprise. Trump campaigned against the scientific consensus on climate change and against burdensome environmental regulations. Hes put climate skeptics in charge of the EPA and in the White House. The extent of the action may be unprecedented, but anyone who is surprised by these moves has not been paying attention.\nSecond, this is more Republicanism than Trumpism. Most likely, Jeb Bush wouldve made many of the same changes. There are some distinctively Trumpist elements to it-pandering to coal miners (the president made a pledge to the coal industry to do whatever he can to help those workers, the official said), calling the policy America First. But those are more rhetorical than substantive. In fact, most of these changes are the ones that mainstream Republicans have been demanding for years. This order is as much Reince Priebus as Steve Bannon.\nIndeed, the only reason that Trump can so swiftly roll back eight years of Obama administration policy is that the Republican-dominated congress refused to act on climate change. That left it to the executive branch to do the heavy lifting with regulations, executive orders, and other rules-all of which can be overturned by the next administration, as we are now seeing.\nFinally, the White House official repeatedly expressed the presidents desire to get EPA back to its core mission of protecting clean air and clean water. That spells bad news for everything else the EPA does: scientific research, climate change prevention, promotion of alternative fuels, protecting against environmental injustice, and so on.\nThere were a couple of interesting developments, however.\nFirst, the Trump administration did not formally abandon the Paris Agreement on climate change, stating that it was still under discussion. While this might offer a glimmer of hope to environmentalists, more likely its simply a tactical move. Why formally withdraw from an international accord when you can simply ignore it and miss its targets? Better to sin and ask forgiveness later than to cause a ruckus now.\nSecond, the administration has more finely tuned its rhetoric regarding climate change. At the briefing, journalists were told that, in fact, the president does believe in man-made climate change. Indeed, when pressed, even the official, who as recently as four months ago was a lobbyist for fossil fuel companies, admitted that he, too, believed in man-made climate change.\nYep, sure, I do, he said (after first saying its not relevant what I think). The issue is to what extent, and how serious, and the magnitude of it, and a lot of other questions that flow from that.\nThat is a more nuanced view than outright climate denial, or even climate skepticism. You might call it climate meh. As in: OK, climate change is happening, but its probably not such a big deal. In the words of Whitney Houston, its not right, but its OK.\nThat view still runs directly counter to the entirety of the scientific communitys estimates, which range from bad to catastrophic. But it is a brilliant political shift. Instead of baldly denying the science (and the weather, for that matter), the administration now invites us into the weeds of how much, how bad, how complex... how dull.\nThe Whitney Houston view also makes fighting climate change a matter of balancing. Its an issue that deserves attention, said the official, but the president has been very clear that were not going to pursue climate or environmental policies that put the U.S. economy at risk.\nSee how that works-its not right, but its OK, and so we can balance it out against these other things. (Several journalists pointed out that climate change will be economically devastating, as coastal cities must protect against being inundated, extreme weather events increase in frequency, and crop belts shift northward-but the official played dumb. Id like the see the research, he said.)\nWhat, finally, is an America First energy policy? Per the executive order, its to remove any obstacles so we can produce energy. But of course, thats really a fossil-fuel-industry first energy policy. Everything else just got sent to the back of the line.\n'b'Re: "Mountains of Oman could hold the Holy Grail of climate change," April 15. \nThis reporter makes two claims about potential global warming that are patently false. One claim is that "current estimates hold that the world will be six degrees Celsius hotter by 2100." \nIn fact, in its 2013 report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates likely warming by 2100 of only 1.7 degrees C (this is considerably lower than its 2007 prediction of 3.8 degrees C by 2100 and a far cry from the news report\'s "current estimate" of six degrees). Meanwhile, actual global warming continues to be way under the IPCC model predictions and has almost flat-lined since 1998 (the so-called "pause" that many climate scientists continue to deny). \nAdding to the misinformation, the article states: "In 2015, 196 nations signed the Paris climate accords, agreeing to curb greenhouse gas emissions to levels that would keep the rise in the Earth\'s temperature to under 2 C." \nWhile it\'s true that this agreement was signed, most climate scientists admit that, even if all nations did what they promised under the Paris agreement, warming would be affected by a fraction of a degree Celsius at best. The Paris agreement is window-dressing, not an effective policy - an effective policy would be economic suicide for any nation that tried it. \nPaul MacRae \nVictoria\nCredit: Paul Macrae; Times Colonist\n'b'Climate change deniers like Brian Pratt of Saskatoon ("Climate change an excuse to hike taxes," July 29) have their heads firmly buried in the sand. There is nearuniversal agreement in the scientific community that climate change is occurring and is a deadly threat to the planet and humankind. Many scientific organizations, including NASA, have expressed concerns over global climate change. \nThe American Association for the Advancement of Science has stated, "The scientific evidence is clear: global climate change caused by human activities is occurring now, and it is a growing threat to society." In 2012, The American Meteorological Society reported: "It is clear from extensive scientific evidence that the dominant cause of the rapid change in climate of the past half century is human-induced increases in the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), chlorofluorocarbons, methane, and nitrous oxide." Even the American Medical Association has opined on climate change (2013): The AMA "supports the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\'s fourth assessment report and concurs with the scientific consensus that the Earth is undergoing adverse global climate change and that anthropogenic contributions are significant." \nAs virtually all scientific evidence indicates, it will soon be too late to do anything to prevent the impending disaster our planet faces. The time to act is now. \nWake up, Mr. Pratt! \nDavid P. Millar \nRegina\nCredit: David P. Millar; The Leader-Post\n'b'Creighton University issued the following news release:\nCreighton University President the Rev. Daniel S. Hendrickson, SJ, today joined with more than 150 signatories, including leaders from more than 70 Catholic colleges and universities from around the United States, in sending a letter to President Donald Trump and the U.S. Congress urging more dedicated action on climate change.\nThe letter from the Catholic Climate Covenant, and with roots in the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops\' 2001 statement titled "Global Climate Change: A Plea for Dialogue, Prudence, and the Common Good," and Catholic social teaching on care for God\'s creation, asks the administration and legislative body to fully engage with the best available climate science, fund the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, honor U.S. commitments to the Green Climate Fund, and meaningfully participate in the 23rd session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC.\n"So consistently, human-caused global climate change has been documented by the most advanced scientific tools we have," Fr. Hendrickson said. "We at Creighton University remain passionately committed to reducing our ecological impact, and I sign on to this letter urging our elected and appointed officials to help our entire nation -- and with our leadership, the world round -- make greater strides in this global fight. Our Jesuit, Catholic values impel us to care deeply for our common home and I trust the leadership in the White House and Congress will recognize the responsibility we all share in combating climate change."\nAlso prompted by the Nov. 3 National Climate Assessment from 13 federal agencies concluding greenhouse gas emissions and other human activities are responsible for an increased global warming trend over the last century, the letter asks for special consideration given the rising human toll of climate change, especially among poor and vulnerable populations.\n"Catholic leaders across the nation and world have explicitly and consistently affirmed climate change as a moral issue that threatens core Catholic commitments, including to: protect human life, promote human dignity, exercise a preferential option for the poor and vulnerable, advance the common good, live in solidarity with future generations, and care for God\'s creation which is our common home," the letter reads, in part.\nThis document was posted showing the date: Nov. 16, 2017.\nMSTRUCK-6078825 MSTRUCK\n'b" \nAs issues of climate change get complex every day and every time, many actors and stakeholders have emerged and occupied considerable space, with the idea of moving the climate change discourse ahead and to other levels.\n\nBy Peter Makwanya  \nBut as the green actors and stakeholders alike, advocate for climate change behavioural change, one wonders how much climate for change they are putting in place.\nIn this regard, special attention is to be focussed on the role effective communication play in facilitating a climate for change environment.\nIt appears, the climate change agents and their stakeholders alike have not yet struck the right chord, therefore, practically, and they are simply not yet there, as they are currently and seriously entrenched in the vicious climate mix.\nThe main question is how much effective communication can be implemented to culminate into the creation of climate for change, tough enough to foster resilience and environmental sustainability for the sustainable future that we all want.\nIn as much as movements and organisations for social change exert pressure for environmental sustainability, it is only pressure against the hidden and enormous counter-movements from the rich and powerful, who are advocates against the real climate for change.\nIn this regard, the transition towards a sustainable socio-economic change is facing enormous obstacles, hidden behind the language of glib, deception, communication massaging, and rhetoric as well as climate change denial.\nCore to the mantra of green movements and activism should be adaptation and then issues of resilience would be shaped by sustainable adaptation.\nOf course, the reduction of greenhouse gases need also to be central to their green living campaigns but on this aspect, they need to prepare more than battle, as denialists and climate sinners are ever ready and prepared to throw carbon footprints everywhere as obstacles.\nThe hidden institutions of denialism always have something up their sleeves against the creation of a climate for change.\nAs the situation stands right now, it would appear as if countries are heading for a rapid acceleration and expansion of the establishment of climate-friendliest technologies in the form of renewable energy but the intended beneficiaries are yet to realise a meaningful climate for change in this regard, despite all the hype and high level conferences.\nIt is also equally significant and paramount that stakeholders in green movements and activism should transform and make versatile changes to the way they communicate for the climate for change.\nThis is where their enormous rhetoric should be toned down towards sustainable engagement and inclusivity in order to fight massive cooperate sponsored glib from established institutions of denialism.\nWhen people reach or attain the level where communication can transform and facilitate the establishment of climate for change then we can start to see the beginning of the unfolding of the new paradigm shift and impetus.\nIn developing countries, before we could talk of the aspect of communication challenges as other forms of obstacles, the other militating barriers which are in the form of lack of meaningful infrastructure development in order to complement efforts towards the desired climate for change.\nIn some instances and situations, infrastructural establishments may not be existing, rather substandard, dilapidated or all of the above.\nAs such, the people of these contexts and settings cannot be expected to move at the same wave length with those from the developed countries.\nIn this regard, the role of effective communication employed in the developing countries should be used to the existing procedural barriers and uplift their standards of living, spirits and social motivations to the same levels as those in the developed countries.\nOf course, too many communicators and change agents may either duplicate roles of failure to communicate effectively if these aspects are not handled quite well, hence they may not communicate.\nTherefore, inclusivity and engagement should be able to remove or tame existing obstacles and barriers, militating against the creation of meaningful climate for change.\nIt would also be interesting to note that some of these barriers and obstacles are firmly entrenched in their thoughts and imaginations hence it would be necessary to cleanse their world-views and imaginations so that they are transformed and initiated to the current discourse for social change.\nThese can come about as a result of being able to do away with the prevailing socio-cultural myths which can also culminate into climate change of myths as well.\nThe climate change are still very much prevalent and common in developing countries, hence they have to be termed constructively.\nOtherwise, if they are not termed or even powerfully designed, communication strategies may end up not achieving desired and sustainable results, aimed at creating a sustainable climate for change as against the idea of climate change.\n\n Peter Makwanya is a climate change communicator.

Whether it is the spread of mountain pine beetle infestations, increased frequency of wildfires, or extreme drought, climate change threatens to affect the way of life for many Montanans.\nMontana has some of the best fly fishing in the country, with abundant wild trout populations and numerous blue-ribbon trout streams. Montanas fly fishing industry is a huge economic driver, providing thousands of jobs and bringing tens of millions of dollars in consumer spending to the Treasure State each year. But the industry has already seen negative impacts from the greatest threat to cold water fisheries around the West.\nLast year, anglers witnessed unprecedented fishing restrictions on our rivers due to low stream flows and warm water temperatures. According to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, 2016 saw a record number of water bodies restricted around the state and some of the earliest closures ever, some beginning as early as late June. In addition to these restrictions, low flows and warm temperatures exacerbated a largescale outbreak of proliferative kidney disease (PKD) in mountain whitefish, resulting in the shutdown of 186 miles of the Yellowstone River to all recreation. The economic impacts from the closure were felt by business owners around the region.\nThis spring, the above-average snowpack in most of the state gave hope to many anglers that 2017 would be a good water year. However, with scorching heat in the month of July and little to no precipitation, rivers and streams dropped very rapidly, leading to warm water temperatures and subsequent hoot-owl restrictions.\nA large-scale interagency study led by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in 2012 looked at changes in stream discharge in five major Western watershed basins. Comparing stream discharge to historical data from 1950-2009, the study found a common trend across basins of greater discharge earlier in the year leading to less discharge later in summer months.\nThough the need for fishing restrictions was non-existent decades ago, they are now the new norm in Montana as climate change is having a dramatic impact on snowpack and hydrologic cycles.\nThe Montana Wildlife Federation (MWF) has been gathering input from Montana hunters and anglers on climate change for several years. Earlier this year, MWF launched a program to hear from outfitters, guides and other fishing industry professionals. This effort gives guides the opportunity to meet with local biologists to talk about the effects of climate change already seen in their local rivers. The program also features an opportunity for guides to speak on the issue and brainstorm opportunities to take action.\nWhen anglers and business owners work together, a lot more can be done to combat the negative impacts of climate change. If our elected officials are not working in the best interests of the citizens of Montana, including business owners who rely on our rivers, then they must be held accountable.\nClimate change is not a partisan issue and anglers, guides, outfitters and other business owners who care for the health of our rivers are showing the courage to look 50 years into the future and step up to the plate to combat climate change. Sportsmen have long been the stewards of conservation of fish and wildlife. With collective action, anglers can keep it that way and help preserve our outdoor traditions for future generations.\n'b"On Aug. 24, 2016, United States Sen. Steve Daines said at a public meeting in Livingston on the Yellowstone fish kill that he wanted to find out what caused it and prevent it from ever happening again. \nGlobal warming driven by the burning of fossil fuels caused it.\nAlthough the immediate cause was proliferative kidney disease, or PKD, the parasite that causes the disease thrives in the low stream flows and high water temperatures caused by climate change. In fact Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks reported at the time of the outbreak that Yellowstone River flows were near historic lows and daytime high water temperature in the Yellowstone at Livingston hovered around 70 degrees for more than a month, starting in mid-July. Ideal temperature for mountain whitefish and trout is in the mid-50s.\nGlobal warming is caused by human activity, a finding accepted by over 99.99 percent of published climate scientists.\nYet Daines has the audacity to reject this indisputable scientific fact. We view science as a way to deepen our appreciation and wonder at the majesty of Gods creation, including the complex, beautiful and life-sustaining planet earth. We see no conflict between our religious faith and the findings of science.\nWe cannot remain silent while a U.S. senator from Montana chooses willful ignorance of the greatest threat this state has ever faced and which is already causing extreme damage to our cherished Montana environment.\nThe simple moral truth is that United States is by far the worlds largest historic contributor to the climate crisis and therefore bears the greatest responsibility for addressing it. Why do you look at the speck of dust in your brothers eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? as Jesus once asked.\nThe Carbon Vulnerability Monitor reports that many hundreds of children, per day, are dying from climate change, mostly from hunger and communicable diseases. But since the overwhelming majority of these victims are poor and live in distant lands, it may be easy for a U.S. senator to think he can write them off. We remind the senator that no one is left out in the vision of humanity that we believe that Jesus of Nazareth embodied in his life and teaching, least of all the poor and marginalized that were such an abiding focus of his concern.\nFurthermore, Daines voted to confirm the nomination of Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Scott Pruitt, like Daines, also chooses to deny the reality of climate change, including stating recently that he does not believe that carbon dioxide is causing global warming, when in fact its excess accumulation in the atmosphere is the primary cause of the climate crisis. When the head of a federal agency has trouble accepting a fact the average fifth-grader grasps, its probably because the federal official is not interested in the truth.\nDaines has said that he cares about Montanas environment. He has also stressed how important his Christian faith is to him. Well, as someone once said, Don't tell me what you believe in. I'll observe how you behave and I will make my own determination.\nDaines can prove both of his convictions by immediately and publicly declaring that he accepts the scientific fact that currently unfolding climate change is caused by human activity, primarily the burning of fossil fuels.\nBy transforming gratitude for creation into action at this critical time, Senator Daines could help to bestow much-needed care and protection for Montana and all humanity.\n"b'\nUNDP Country Director, Mandisa Mashologu\n Nigeria, with support from the United Nations Development Programme, held an inception meeting to develop the nation\'s Third National Communication (TNC) on its emission and removal of greenhouse gases (GHGs), as prescribed by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Bennett Oghifo reports As part of their commitment to honouring Agreements on climate change, which seeks to lower global temperatures below 2C, Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are expected to send reports, known as National Communication, to the secretariat, providing information on emission and removal of greenhouse gases in their various countries. The National Communication (NC) is submitted every four years to the secretariat by each Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It provides information on emissions and removals of greenhouse gases (GHG) and details of the activities a Party has undertaken to implement the UNFCCC, among other information about the status of Climate Change in the country. Nigeria, with assistance from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP Nigeria), has provided two National Communications to the UNFCCC secretariat.\nRecently, the Federal Ministry of Environment\'s Climate Change Department, also with the aid of UNDP, brought together stakeholders in Keffi, Nasarawa State to aggregate information that would constitute the Third National Communication (TNC). TNC\'s objective... \nThe preparation of the Third National Communication (TNC) and the strengthening of institutional and analytical capacities would enable the country to prepare improved climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, enhanced technology transfer for adaptation and mitigation, and functional sustained institutional capacity for developing future national communications. Role of UNDP... \nIt is determined that UNDP Nigeria assistance to national climate change effort within UNDAF 2014 - 2017 recognizes an increase in the country\'s vulnerability to climatic changes and identifies that sustainable funding is critical to addressing the challenges effectively. In his remarks at the TNC workshop in Keffi, UNDP Country Director, Mandisa Mashologu said, "United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in partnership with the Federal Ministry of Environment have over the years invested in the preparation, collection and validation of data on GHG emissions which have resulted in the successful preparation and submission of Nigeria\'s First and Second National Communications to UNFCCC. "The Third National Communications (TNC) will therefore be building on the strong national capacities developed with the support of UNDP and lessons learnt over the years."\nThe TNC, Mashologu said "takes on a whole new significant meaning, coming on the heels of the country\'s active participation in the negotiations, ongoing development of a Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) and ratification of Paris Agreement by the President, with which Nigeria has clearly demonstrated political will and commitment to tackling climate change. "This is why a national institutional framework approach that will ensure full participation of relevant MDAS in the identification of potential for options for GHG emissions reduction across all sectors, sourcing of the necessary data is being promoted to improve the quality and consistency of the data and ensure reliability." Federal Government\'s position... \nAt the opening of the 2-day Inception Workshop, the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Environment, Dr. Shehu Ahmed said the main objective of the meeting was to create an enabling process involving all relevant national stakeholders to prepare and submit Nigeria\'s Third National Communication (TNC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. According to Dr. Ahmed, Nigeria ratified the UNFCCC and submitted its Initial and Second National Communication reports in November 2003 and June 2014 respectively. "It is in line with fulfilling its obligations to the Convention that the Government of Nigeria through the Department of Climate Change, Federal Ministry of Environment is initiating the process of preparing the Third National Communication report on Climate Change. "The First and Second National Communication provided the baseline information on inventories of greenhouse gases, mitigations, vulnerabilities and adaptation to climate change, awareness and education activities and proposed projects for further monitoring and mitigating climate change." He said, "Preparing National Communication report presents huge opportunity for the collection of climate relevant data that will help us to better plan our economies and also respond to global challenges of climate change and commitments. In fact, the Third National Communication should present an opportunity to transform the process from merely reporting to development of a strategic and policy support tool. "Fully aware of the seriousness and urgency of climate change and with a deep sense of responsibility for a long-term development of mankind, Nigeria has reaffirmed its firm commitment to sustainable development that takes cognizance of the need to mainstream climate change into its development process and plans, aimed to position the country to become on the top 20 economies in the world by 2020, and to promote climate resilient environmental sustainability in the context of national development. He noted that "Nigeria is highly vulnerable to the impact of climate change. It poses a serious threat to our national sustainable development, efforts to reduce poverty and the overall socio-economic well-being of our citizens."\nHe recalled that Nigeria signed the Paris Agreement in September 2016, committing the country to pursue efforts towards its implementation. "Also, we submitted an ambitious Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) now NDC of a conditional commitment of 45%, and an unconditional commitment to further reduce GHG emissions by 20% by 2030. Presently, activities towards the development of the sectoral plan for implementation of Nationally Determined Contribution are ongoing.\n"Besides putting great efforts to access global climate finance through the development of a Nigeria National Readiness Plan for assessing the Green Climate Fund (GCF), we are developing pipeline of projects to be submitted to the Green Climate Fund for funding. "Moreover, we are interfacing with the National Assembly to develop a robust Legislative Framework to strengthen policy and actions on climate change and to provide measures that are developmental, evidence based, balanced and fully integrated in line with national aspirations." The Federal Ministry of Environment, he said "has Instituted national Climate Change Knowledge fair and exhibition, which is to serve as the national forum for information and a gateway to national and global knowledge providing fair access to knowledge and information to as many on climate change issues." He assured that the Ministry was committed to implementing the overall mandate of the Climate Change Convention and its Protocol. "We will continue to work towards the provision of adequate budgetary allocation for climate change activities. This present administration acknowledges that inaction is even far more expensive as it will hinder the actualization of Mr. President\'s change mantra and the Sustainable Development Goals." The Permanent Secretary appreciated the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) "for their invaluable support and partnership. We are grateful for the selfless service and commitment towards our national development." Dr. Yerima Peter Tarfa, Director, Department of Climate Change, while welcoming participants, noted that "Climate Change has emerged as one of the most important issues facing the global community in the 21st century.\n"It is expected to pose a serious threat to development and livelihoods, and the effects will be felt more strongly by the developing countries, that rely on the natural environment for their livelihoods and have less capacity to adapt to the adverse impact of climate change," he said. Dr. Tarfa said the purpose of preparing National Communications was to ascertain the level of Greenhouse Gas composition in the atmosphere, the Vulnerability, Adaptation and Abatement analysis of impacts of Climate Change. "It also serves as a basis for reference on future auditing of Greenhouse Gas Inventory in the country. "The Department of Climate Change in collaboration with the UNDP have organised this stakeholder\'s inception workshop, which has brought together the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change (ICCC), Academia, relevant private sector organizations, NGOs, and the Media to among other things assist all stakeholders and partners to fully understand and take ownership of the project. "As we are gearing up now for the preparation of the Third National Communication, we need data, more especially Primary and spatial data to understand the processes at play and build projections we can trust. These are essential for sustainable development planning and strengthening resilience in our communities. "Also, we need to fill the knowledge gap observed in the BUR and the previous national Communications. We therefore count on you as custodian of some of the needed data and information to make it available, when we come calling in the near future." He acknowledged the strong commitment of the UNDP as the Ministry\'s for their continuous support towards national efforts in tackling climate change strategic partner and Nigeria government towards the environment and climate change issues and are committed to continue our engagement and support to the government to achieve our jointly stated goals.\n Copyright 2017 THISDAY NEWSPAPERS LTD.

Small island states and low-lying countries will be worst hit. About 2.5 million people in Bangladesh would be affected.\nMore severe impacts can be avoided if global greenhouse gas emissions are reduced.\nHowever, if carbon dioxide emissions continue and global warming exceeds 4C, sea levels will rise further.\nIncreased rainfall is expected to further compound the flooding risk by raising river levels.\n"A warmer atmosphere can hold more water, so rainfall would be more intense," Prof Betts said.\n"This would inevitably mean more flooding, and our research suggests the largest increase in flood risk would be in parts of America, Asia and Europe." At 4C, the researchers say most countries - nations accounting for 73% of world\'s population and 79% of the global GDP - could experience a five-fold increase in river flood risk and flood damage compared to the period 1976 to 2005.\nAt that level, 4C British farmers would find it harder to grow wheat - but easier to grow maize.\nHELIX scientists advised EU officials before they signed the 2015 Paris Agreement, in which 195 countries pledged to keep warming "well below" 2C. The research findings suggest flooding risk would double at 1.5C and rise by 170% at 2C.\nProfessor Betts said: "This wetter climate should also mean fewer droughts in some areas, though droughts could become more common in parts of Africa and southern Europe.\n"Overall, worldwide food security would be more at risk, not just from changing crop yields but because extreme weather affects the people who grow the crops."\nHELIX used sophisticated computer models and vast datasets to produce its projections.\nProfessor Betts said: "It is clear that humanity has a huge challenge to deal with here.\n"The countries of the world have agreed to try to minimise global warming, and the debate has now moved on to exactly how to achieve this is - but we will have to live with some changes that are already unavoidable."\n\nCAPTION: A storm batters Perranporth in Cornwall in February 2014.

With Pakistan appearing to take the threat of climate change seriously, its efforts towards climate change mitigation could make a substantive difference for future generations. However, this will require sustained commitment to the implementation of climate change policies in their true letter and in spirit in the long term. Whether through international investment or regional cooperation, Pakistan must draw uponglobal resources and cooperation to further its progress against environmental pressures at home.\n'The increases in temperature (owing to climate change) would lead to drastic changes in the (Asian) region's weather system, agriculture and fisheries sectors, land and marine biodiversity, domestic and regional security, trade, urban development, migration, and health. Such a scenario may even pose an existential threat to some countries in the region and crush any hope of achieving sustainable and inclusive development,' said the report entitled, 'A Region At Risk: The Human Dimensions of Climate Change in Asia and the Pacific,' released on Friday at the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) headquarters in Manila, jointly produced by the ADB and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).\nAccording to the report, development gains will be at risk of being reversed by the climate change induced effects unless the regional states do not take urgent actions, such as clean industrial revolution. In sum, the report makes for grim reading, should the predictions eventuate as under a 'business as usual' scenario, a 6 Celsius temperature rise is projected over the Asian landmass by the end of the century, with an increase as high as 8 C forecasted in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and northwest China.\nIn furtherance to this, according to the report, Pakistan could see a decline in rainfall by 20 to 50 percent whereas annual precipitation is expected to increase by up to 50 percent over most land areas in Asia. Resultantly, food production will suffer, generating food shortages that would increase the number of malnourished children in South Asia by 7 million. In Pakistan, around 159m children under the age of five are stunted with heights much less than normal for that age, and with nearly 240m children at risk of developmental impairment at present.\nSuch downward trend would lead to disruptions to farming communities, mass migration to the cities, energy insecurity and many more. According to the World Health Organisation, Pakistan is also vulnerable to damaging heat effects of climate change, which is already causing 3.3 million deaths each year globally, led by China, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Therefore, timely response is a need of the hour to respond effectively to the challenges posed by climate change.\nThough Pakistan has scores of laws for environmental preservation, but their weak implementation is resulting in environmental degradation. For example, Pakistan Environmental Protection Act (PEPA), which was passed back in 1997, is responsible to mandate Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) reports for (yet to start) projects that can have negative implications for the domestic environment. However, it is reported that the latest metro bus project connecting the Federal capital with the New Islamabad International Airport, going to be inaugurated on this year, has been started without due process.\nNevertheless, pragmatic and practicable way forward can turn loopholes into opportunities. For example, the recently-passed Pakistan Climate Change Act, 2016 is a critical step in the right direction. The law creates three new institutions to address the growing dangers of climate change: 1) the Pakistan Climate Change Council, 2) the Pakistan Climate Change Authority, and 3) the Pakistan Climate Change Fund. The Climate Change Council, chaired by the prime minister, will serve as the broad policy-making and regulatory body for Pakistan's future climate change policies. The Climate Change Council will receive recommendations from the Climate Change Authority, which will formulate policies, mitigation plans, legislation, and implementation standards needed for sustainable development in Pakistan. What Pakistan needs is the quick start for effective implementation of these laws.\n"b'The Red Cross has released a Climate Ready Communities Guide to reduce casualties experienced due to climate change.\nWith natural disasters striking more frequently, Red Cross Acting Director Jai O\'Toole said climate change is happening and it\'s here to stay.\n"Right now we\'re seeing along the eastern seaboard just how widespread Cyclone Debbie\'s devastation was," he said.\n"The poor and most vulnerable are often the hardest hit so it\'s essential that people are equipped to adapt and thrive in the changing conditions.\n"The changes we are seeing impact just about every aspect of society.\n"Many people are already doing things to adapt to a changing climate - even if they don\'t label it as such.\n"It\'s important we build upon these actions and support all communities to become climate ready."\nThe Guide helps people take control over what can seem to be an unmanageable issue.\nSA Climate Change Minister Ian Hunter said, "This helps everyone understand how climate change will affect them and what we can all do to help our communities adapt.\n"South Australia has been an early leader in climate adaptation, not only in preparing our communities but through encouraging them to take advantage of the significant opportunities that taking action on climate change brings."\nThe Guide is broken into four parts:\nThis summer\'s heatwaves and record temperatures in South Australia highlight the risk communities face.\nMr O\'Toole said every day Red Cross sees the impacts of climate change on those least able to cope.\n"Older people all alone.

People with a disability, mental health, alcohol or drug issues.\n"These are the people who most feel the brunt of these weather extremes," he said.\nExtreme temperatures contribute to the deaths of over 1,000 people aged 65 and over each year, according to the Climate Institute.\nThe number is expected to increase substantially in line with Australia\'s increasing temperatures and more frequent, intense heatwaves.\n"Adapting everything we do to a new and changing climate is a shared responsibility. No one person, group, business or government can do it alone," Mr O\'Toole said.\nThe guide was funded by the Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources and is available on the Red Cross website.\n'b'Editor: \nThe "Made in Saskatchewan Climate Change Strategy" produced by the Province\'s government describes the good people of the Saskatchewan as pragmatic, resourceful and innovative, and indeed, this has been my experience with most of the folks I\'ve met. \nThroughout their history they have faced complex, challenging problems, and have the "can do" attitude that can get things done.

He provided scant evidence of the public\'s ignorance but lots of numbers supposedly exposing its source: center-right groups that form a "climate change counter-movement."\nMr. Brulle\'s smoking-gun statistic--call it the Brulle Number--was the combined annual income of 91 alleged conspirators. He calculated that from 2003 to 2010, these groups\' revenues averaged "just over $900 million" annually. The media twisted that into an even more extreme claim: "Conservative groups spend $1bn a year to fight action on climate change," as a Guardian headline  put it.\nThat\'s false twice over. Mr. Brulle didn\'t measure spending but income. Nor did he isolate the amount spent on climate issues, although most of the groups he studied had many policy interests.\nMr. Brulle\'s wide net snared groups like the Intermountain Rural Electric Association, which provides electricity to Coloradans. He counted every penny of the nonprofit\'s annual income as though it were a K Street powerhouse.\nA new Capital Research Center study cuts Mr. Brulle\'s calculations down to size. He claimed that the 91 "conspirators" had a combined income of $1.51 billion in 2010. Simply by counting income rather than spending he inflated their efforts by $169 million.\nBy speaking to the organizations, examining itemized IRS filings, tallying media mentions and webpages, and reading annual reports, we found that no more than 6% of their 2010 spending engaged the public on climate science. That knocks $1.24 billion off the $1.51 billion Brulle Number for that year.\nOnce corrected, the 2010 Brulle Number shrinks by 93% to only $100 million. That\'s an imperfect estimate, but we\'ve posted our data online at ClimateDollars.org . Unlike Mr. Brulle, we welcome debate.\nMr. Brulle lists  our organization as a conspirator because Exxon and Koch-related philanthropies have supported us in the past. But Exxon stopped a decade ago, and donors interested in climate issues have never provided more than 10% of our annual revenues. Nor have we ever devoted more than 10% of our spending to climate science.\nIronically, Mr. Brulle once attacked the center-left researcher Matthew Nisbet for using the same methodology to study the income of environmentalist groups. Mr. Nisbet concluded that groups with alarmist views on climate change enjoyed $1.7 billion in revenues, versus $907 million for think tanks, advocacy groups, and industry associations on the other side.\nYet the nonprofit funding on both sides is dwarfed by federal programs that assume the dangers of climate change. The best estimate, based on Office of Management and Budget data , is that from 1993 to 2014, federal expenditures exceeded $166 billion in 2012 dollars .\nWho really has the power?\nMr. Allen is vice president of the Capital Research Center in Washington.\nCredit: By Steven J.

The fee is increased gradually over time. This creates a price signal to transition to cleaner sources and uses of energy. It also increases energy efficiency.\nSo that families are protected from the economic impact of rising energy costs, all the revenue from the carbon fee is returned to every household as equal shares. So that American businesses can compete on a level playing field - and to encourage other nations to follow our lead - an adjustment fee is placed on imports coming from nations that do not have an equivalent carbon price.\nCCL seeks to create a broad foundation for climate action across all geographic regions and political inclinations.

Here is how a withdrawal is likely to unfold, if Mr. Trump follows through on his plan:\nAccording to the Paris pact, countries can only exit three years after the effective date of the deal. That was Nov. 4, 2016, 30 days after a sufficient number of countries ratified the deal reached in December 2015.\nThe Paris accord was reached as part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC, which took effect in 1994 and includes 197 countries, including the U.S. The convention was ratified by the Senate in 1992. If Mr. Trump had taken the "nuclear option" and withdrawn from the UNFCCC, he could have left the pact in a year.\nStarting in November 2019, Mr. Trump could send a written request to exit from the accord. Backers of the deal built in a delay to allow a global shift in climate politics to dissuade governments from exiting. The U.S. president could also change his mind by late 2019, just as the 2020 presidential campaign heats up.\nAfter the UNFCCC receives Mr. Trump\'s request, the U.S. would be out of the Paris agreement after one year, or as early as November 2020.\nThe real result of Mr. Trump\'s move would only be apparent in 2025, when the targets of the Paris agreement become effective. The nonbinding U.S. target was to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions by 26% to 28% below their 2005 levels.\nEnvironmental groups say the Paris agreement was designed to be durable, and a future U.S. administration could get Washington back into the pact, assuming the U.S. stays in the underlying UNFCCC.\nCredit: By William Mauldin\n'b'The Canadian Press \nEDMONTON \nClimate change is pulling the environmental rug out from under the great majority of the parks and protected areas in North America, federal research suggests. \nMarc-Andre Parisien, of the Canadian Forest Service, is a co-author of a paper that studies how shifts in climate are causing ecological regions in conserved areas to move. \n"The climates that are in western Montana and the panhandle of Idaho and parts of Colorado are eventually going to be in Banff National Park," he said. \nThat means the temperature, precipitation, moisture and growing season that define Banff now will be pushed out. \nParisien first calculated the rate of movement of climate zones. He and his colleagues used that climate velocity to estimate how far ecosystems will shift by the end of the century. They then looked at the boundaries of 4,512 protected areas in Canada, the United States and Mexico. \nFor nearly 80 per cent of those areas, the climate that helped define them will have simply moved on. \n"You have the potential to migrate hundreds of kilometres away from your current location," said Parisien. \nCanadian parks are likely to be most heavily affected, he said. \nThe study predicts that the climates that helped create the Rocky Mountain national parks in Alberta and British Columbia will move thousands of kilometres by the end of the century. Almost every park in Canada, with the exception of some coastal areas in northern British Columbia and Nunavut, will see its former climate move outside current boundaries. \n"Over 100 years, that\'ll be challenging for a lot of species," Parisien said. \n"If you\'re an insect or a bird, it might be fairly easy. But if you\'re a tree or a rare plant, you\'re going to have some problems." \nParisien\'s projections are based on current rates of fossil fuel usage. Cutting carbon emissions to keep global warming under two degrees Celsius would improve the outlook considerably.\nCredit: Sender_2\n'b'US-Trump-Ice-Caps-Fact-Check, Agate 3rd Writethru\ncode:6 \nUpdate:(Adds photo, links, changes number of scientists from 9 to 10.

I mean, look, it used to not be climate change, it used to be global warming. That wasn\'t working too well because it was getting too cold all over the place."\nTen different climate scientists contacted by The Associated Press said the president was not accurate about climate change. Rutgers University climate scientist Jennifer Francis responded in an email: "Clearly President Trump is relying on alternative facts to inform his views on climate change. Ice on the ocean and on land are both disappearing rapidly, and we know why: increasing greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels that trap more heat and melt the ice. "\nTHE FACTS: The world hasn\'t had a cooler than average year since 1976 and hasn\'t had a cooler than normal month since the end of 1985, according to more than 135 years of temperature records kept by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nThe last four years have been the four hottest years on record globally, with 2010 the fifth hottest year, according to NOAA. Every year in the 21st century has been at least three quarters of a degree (0.4 degrees Celsius) warmer than the 20th century average and in the top 25 hottest years on record, NOAA records show.\nAnd while a good chunk of the United States had a frigid snap recently, most of the rest of the world was far warmer than normal, according to temperature records.\nZeke Hausfather of the Berkeley Earth temperature monitoring program - initially funded by non-scientists who doubt that the world is warming - said in an email: "The world has been warming steadily over the past 50 years, with 17 of the past 18 years being the warmest since records began in the 1850s. It is not accurate to say that the climate has been \'cooling as well as warming\'."\n---\nTRUMP: "The ice caps were going to melt, they were going to be gone by now, but now they\'re setting records. They\'re at a record level."\nTHE FACTS: It is a bit more nuanced, but not quite right.\nWhile a small number of experts a decade ago had predicted that Arctic would be free of summer sea ice by now, most mainstream scientists and the United Nations\' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change did not, instead they said Arctic sea ice would shrink, which it has, said Pennsylvania State University ice scientist Richard Alley. Most scientists, including the director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, are predicting that the Arctic will be free of summer sea ice sometime around the 2040s.\nThe Arctic set a https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/sea-ice-extent-sinks-to-re https://www.nasa.gov/fe record for the lowest amount of sea ice in the winter, when sea ice usually grows to its maximum levels, in March 2017. In 2012, the Arctic set a record for lowest sea ice levels. Sea ice recovered slightly from that record and in 2017 in September, the annual low was only the eighth lowest on record, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. But the 10 lowest years of sea ice have been all in the last 11 years. Arctic sea ice is declining at a rate of 13.2 per cent per decade, according to NASA.\nPrinceton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer said the Antarctic sea ice pack, less directly influenced by global climate change, varies from year to year. Antarctica hit a record low for sea ice in March 2017, the same month the Arctic hit a record winter low. Antarctic sea ice also reached a record high in 2014.\n"Both of the large ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica are losing hundreds of billions of tons of ice per year. Sea ice continues to decline significantly in the Arctic decade by decade, and the thickness of Arctic ice is now less than 50 per cent of what it was 40 years ago," National Snow and Ice Data Center scientist Ted Scambos said in an email.\n---\nAssociated Press writer Gregory Katz in London contributed to this report.\n---\nFollow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears . His work can be found here .\n'b'As soon as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma made landfall in the U.S., scientists, politicians and journalists began to discuss the role of climate change in natural disasters. Although a clear scientific consensus has emerged over the past decade that climate change influences hurricanes in the long run, its effect upon any individual storm is unclear. Anyone trying to score political points after a natural disaster should take a deep breath and review the science first.\nHarvey and Irma broke the record 12-year major-hurricane landfall drought on the U.S. coastline. Since Wilma in October 2005, 31 major hurricanes had swirled in the North Atlantic but all failed to reach the U.S. with a Category 3 or higher intensity.\nEven as we worked to divine exactly where the hurricanes would land, a media narrative began to form linking the devastating storms to climate change. Some found it ironic that states represented by "climate deniers" were being pummeled by hurricanes. Alarmists reveled in the irony that Houston, home to petrochemical plants, was flooded by Harvey, while others gleefully reported that President Trump\'s Mar-a-Lago might be inundated by Irma.\nHow to put these two hurricanes into proper context? An informative website from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, synthesizes reams of research literature on the links between hurricanes and global warming.\nOver the next century, climate models generally indicate fewer but stronger storms -- between 2% and 11% greater average storm intensity -- with substantially increased rain rates. Against the background of slow sea-level rise, explosive coastal population growth will overwhelmingly exacerbate any hurricane\'s damages.\nIn the aggregate, the global-warming signal may just now be emerging out of our noisy observational records, and we may not know certainly for several decades. These conclusions are hardly controversial in the climate-science community.\nMy own research, cited in a recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, found that during the past half-century tropical storms and hurricanes haven\'t shown an upward trend in frequency or accumulated energy. Instead they remain naturally variable from year-to-year.\nThe global prevalence of the most intense storms (Category 4 and 5) hasn\'t shown a significant upward trend either. Historical observations of extreme cyclones in the 1980s, especially in the Southern Hemisphere, are in sore need of reanalysis.\nWhile most details are still hazy with the best climate modeling tools, the bigger issue is that more people are choosing to live in coastal areas, where hurricanes certainly will be most destructive.\nThe nascent field of "attribution science" attempts to explain how climate change may affect characteristics of a given hurricane using models in "what if" mode. Such research requires a faithful reproduction of events and predictions of the future constrained by subjective choices within computer models.\nThis research also takes time -- which means other scientists must examine the evidence with patience and judiciousness not usually seen on Twitter or cable news.\nStill, the scientific community already knows plenty about hurricanes and climate change -- knowledge it has accumulated over two decades through peer-reviewed research, academic conferences and voluminous national and international assessments. Yet climate scientists all too often speculate during interviews rather than refer to IPCC reports or their cousins from the U.S. National Climate Assessment.\nSome climate scientists have peddled tenuous theories with no contemporaneous research evidence. Advocacy groups package these talking points for easy consumption by journalists, who eagerly repeat them.\nThe historical record books contain dozens of devastating hurricane landfalls over the past century, any of which, if repeated, would be catastrophic regardless of additional climate-change effects. To prepare for the next hurricane, the U.S. needs the best weather forecasts, evacuation plans and leadership. These plans should be built on sound science, not speculation, overselling or exaggeration. Hurricane science in this political climate already has enough spin.\n---\nMr. Maue, a research meteorologist, is an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute.\n \nCredit: By Ryan Maue\n'b'It remains to be seen whether French President Emmanuel Macron\'s riposte to US President Trump -"Make Our Planet Great Again" -will actually encourage nations to remain firm on their climate commitments when Trump has also spoken about the option of renegotiating terms for an American re-entry .\nHowever, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat has clearly ruled out the possibility of renegotiation. Member countries had adopted, signed and ratified the accord under the convention. "The Paris Agreement remains a historic treaty signed by 194 and ratified by 147 countries. Therefore, it cannot be renegotiated based on the request of a single party (country)," it said in a statement on Friday.\nNoting the announced intention to renegotiate the modalities for US participation, the UNFCC said, "In this regard, it stands ready to engage in dialogue with the US government regarding implications of this announcement."\nThough experts believe it would be difficult to meet the main goal of the accord, they also believe the announcement at this juncture would at\nthe most be symbolic in nature.\nRules under the Paris Agreement clearly say that the US, technically, cannot withdraw from it before November 4, 2020 -nearly the end of Trump\'s current tenure. Article 28.1 of the accord stipulates that a party can withdraw from it by giving a year\'s written notice to the UN secretary-general only\nafter three years of the agreement having been in force. Since the pact entered into force on November 4 last year, the US, which has ratified it, would be able to give notice of withdrawal earliest on November 4, 2019, and can thereafter withdraw only by November 4, 2020.This is likely to coincide with the next US elections which are usually held between November 2 and November 8.\nIt will take lesser time if the US decides to withdraw from the parent treaty, the UNFCCC. But then Trump will have to face the US Senate. It is, however, uncertain whether courts would hear a judicial challenge to Trump\'s unilateral withdrawal from deal or UNFCCC if the executive and Congress are at an impasse. The question of whether a President has unilateral authority to withdraw from a treaty remains unresolved.\nThis is not the first time the US is opting out of an international climate pact. It pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol saying emerging economies do not have quantified emission targets. But, unlike the Paris accord, the US had not ratified the Kyoto Protocol adopted in 1997.The Kyoto pact had binding targets for emission reductions only for the 38 developed countries. The Paris deal is more comprehensive because it has universal application to all countries.\n'b'India will soon ratify the second commitment period (2013-2020) of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on containing emission of green house gases (GHGs). The Union Cabinet gave its approval for the ratification on Tuesday.\nUnder the Kyoto Protocol (KP) which had become operational in 2005, only developed countries are mandatorily required to undertake mitigation (emission cuts) targets and provide financial resources and transfer of technology to the developing nations.The first commitment period of the Protocol ended in 2012.Though amendment to its second commitment period (2013-2020) was adopted in 2012, only 75 countries have, so far, ratified it. A total of 144 countries are required to ratify the amendment for bringing it into force.\n"Inview of the critical role played by India in securing international consensus on climate change issues, this decision further underlines the country\'s leadership in the comity of nations committed to global cause of environmental protection and climate justice", said a government statement after the Cabinet meeting which was chaired by PM Narendra Modi. It said, "Ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by India will encourage other developing countries also to undertake this exercise".\nIt is believed that the implementation of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects under the KP\'s second commitment period will attract some investments in India as well. The KP was adopted in 1997, recognising that the developed countries are principally responsible for the current high levels of GHGs in the atmosphere. Developing countries like India and China have no mandatory mitigation obligations or targets under the Kyoto Protocol.\nSince the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) seeks to stabilise GHGs concentrations in atmosphere at a level that would minimize interference with the climate system, the global community had in December, 2015 adopted another agreement in Paris which is meant for being operationalised post-2020 (end of the KP\'s second commitment period).\nUnlike the KP which requires only developed countries to take mandatory actions, the Paris Agreement mandates all countries to take action.\n'b'Bonn: Preparing for a climate accord minus the US and laying the ground for a strong European Union leadership role in climate actions, French President Emmanuel Macron has promised to replace American funding to UN\'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and committed to withdraw from fossil fuels, including coal, in due course by transforming the country\'s production model.\nOther countries, including some non-EU nations, too joined the chorus and announced a phase-out of coal under a global alliance led by UK and Canada. Besides France, 19 other nations including New Zealand, Finland, Denmark, Portugal, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium and Italy joined the alliance which committed to gradually close down their coal-fired electricity facilities -- among the world\'s largest sources of air pollution.\nReferring to the US decision to withdraw the $2 million annual donation to the international body which assesses science related to climate change, Macron said, "I can guarantee that starting from 2018, the IPCC will have all the money it needs."\nDelivering his country\'s statement during an ongoing UN climate conference here, Macron declared: "France will meet that challenge. I would like to see the largest number of European countries on our side. All together, we can compensate for the loss of US funding."\nHis remark came as shot in the arm to participants worried by US President Donald Trump\'s decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and cut off all future funding to the IPCC which has put a big question mark on future of the global deal.\n'b'\'Makes it more extreme:\' Prof says climate change added to historic fire season \nBill Graveland \nTHE CANADIAN PRESS [Eth] CALGARY \nClimate change didn\'t directly cause major wildfires in Alberta and British Columbia this year but it did contribute to their extreme nature, says a University of Alberta researcher. \nB.C. recorded its worst-ever fire season. Wildfires that began in early April scorched just over 12,000 square kilometres of timber, bush and grassland and at their height forced 45,000 people from their homes. \nLast month, Waterton Lakes National Park was evacuated after lightning sparked a blaze just inside the B.C. boundary. The flames eventually crossed into the park in southwestern Alberta. \nAnd this last week, wind-whipped grass fires quickly spread and threatened communities in a swath stretching from the Crowsnest Pass in southwestern Alberta all the way into Saskatchewan. \nThe phenomenon isn\'t just in Western Canada, says Mike Flannigan, a professor of wildland fire at the University of Alberta. He points out fires around the world this year have been "head and shoulders above the previous record." \n"There\'s been deadly fires and historic fires in Chile, Portugal [Eth] twice [Eth] and California," Flannigan said in an interview. \n"It\'s been quite a devastating year globally and the California fires will be the most expensive ... (with) tens of billions in losses." \nFlannigan said human-caused climate change isn\'t the root cause of fires, but has made them much worse. Global warming has made conditions more favourable for intense flames. \n"With warmer temperatures, the fuels will be drier, and when a fire goes through, there\'s more fuel to consume," he said. \n"It makes it more extreme. Winds are a little stronger, the temperatures are a little higher and it\'s a little drier." \nFlannigan said warmer temperatures also spawn an increase in lightning activity. For every degree the temperature rises, there\'s a 12 per cent increase in lightning. \nFires have certainly increased in the last several decades, he said. \n"The amount of fire activity in Canada, which currently is about 2 1/2 million hectares [Eth] about half the size of Nova Scotia [Eth] has doubled since the 1970s." \nThe Insurance Bureau of Canada has been watching weather trends with a wary eye. \n"The whole issue of climate change and the severe weather that results from it has been discussed for years ... but really in the last decade we\'ve just seen an explosion in the incidents and the severity of these extreme weather events," said Bill Adams, the Insurance Bureau of Canada\'s western vice-president. \n"It\'s really a continuation of what we\'ve seen for many years where the traditional weather patterns that we\'ve grown up with ... we can\'t rely on them any longer." \nAdams said disasters in Alberta have accounted for about 70 per cent of all claims paid out in the last eight years. Fires, floods and hail account for most. \n"There\'s no question that Alberta has been the epicentre in the Canadian context of the majority of the severe weather events in the last number of years." \n[Eth] Follow @BillGraveland on Twitter\nCredit: Transporter\n'b'They say the sequel is always worse than the original, but Al Gore\'s first film set the bar pretty low.

Over the past 11 years Mr. Gore has suggested that global warming had caused an increase in tornadoes, that Mount Kilimanjaro\'s glacier would disappear by 2016, and that the Arctic summers could be ice-free as soon as 2014. These predictions and claims all proved wrong.\n"An Inconvenient Truth" promoted the frightening narrative that higher temperatures mean more extreme weather, especially hurricanes. The movie poster showed a hurricane emerging from a smokestack. Mr. Gore appears to double down on this by declaring, "Storms get stronger and more destructive. Watch the water splash off the city. This is global warming."\nThis is misleading. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change -- in its Fifth Assessment Report, published in 2013 -- found "low confidence" of increased hurricane activity to date because of global warming. Storms are causing more damage, but primarily because more wealthy people choose to live on the coast, not because of rising temperatures.\nEven if tropical storms strengthen by 2100, their relative cost likely will decrease. In a 2012 article for the journal Nature Climate Change, researchers showed that hurricane damage now costs 0.04% of global gross domestic product. If climate change makes hurricanes stronger, absolute costs will double by 2100. But the world will also be much wealthier and less vulnerable, so the total damage is estimated at only 0.02% of global GDP.\nIn the new film, Mr. Gore addresses "the most criticized scene" of his previous documentary, which suggested that "the combination of sea-level rise and storm surge would flood the 9/11 Memorial site." Then viewers are shown footage of Manhattan taking on water in 2012 after superstorm Sandy, apparently vindicating Mr. Gore\'s claims. Never mind that what he actually predicted was flooding caused by melting ice in Greenland.\nMore important is that Mr. Gore\'s prescriptions -- for New York and the globe -- won\'t work. He claims the answer to warming lies in agreements to cut carbon that would cost trillions of dollars. That wouldn\'t have stopped Sandy. What New York really needs is better infrastructure: sea walls, storm doors for the subway, porous pavement. These fixes could cost around $100 million a year, a bargain compared with the price of international climate treaties.\nMr. Gore helped negotiate the first major global agreement on climate, the Kyoto Protocol. It did nothing to reduce emissions (and therefore to rein in temperatures), according to a March 2017 article in the Journal of Environmental Economics and Management. Undaunted, Mr. Gore still endorses the same solution, and the new documentary depicts him roaming the halls of the Paris climate conference.\nBy 2030 the Paris climate accord will cost the world up to $2 trillion a year, mostly in lost economic growth, according to the best peer-reviewed energy-economic models. It will remain that expensive for the rest of the century. This would make it the most expensive treaty in history.\nAnd for what? Just ahead of the Paris conference, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change estimated that if every country fulfills every promised Paris carbon cut between 2016 and 2030, carbon-dioxide emissions will drop by only 60 gigatons over that time frame. To keep the temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius, the world must reduce such emissions nearly 6,000 gigatons over this century, according to the IPCC. A "successful" Paris agreement wouldn\'t even come close to solving the problem.\nMr. Gore argues that the Paris approach pushes nations and businesses toward green energy. Perhaps, but the global economy is far from ready to replace fossil fuels with solar and wind. The International Energy Agency, in its 2016 World Energy Outlook, found that 0.6% of the world\'s energy is supplied by solar and wind. Even with the Paris accord fully implemented, that number would rise only to 3% in a quarter-century.\nIn part because of activists like Mr. Gore, the world remains focused on subsidizing inefficient, unreliable technology, rather than investing in research to push down the price of green energy.\nReal progress in Paris could be found on the sidelines, where philanthropist Bill Gates and others, including political leaders, agreed to increase spending on research and development. This is an important start, but much more funding is needed.\nMr. Gore declares in his new film that "it is right to save humanity." No argument here. But is using scare tactics really the best way to go about it?\n---\nMr. Lomborg is the president of the Copenhagen Consensus Center and the author of "The Skeptical Environmentalist" and "Cool It."\n \nCredit: By Bjorn Lomborg\n'b'While recent developments like the US abandoning the Paris accord have caused a major setback to the fight against the devastating impact of climate change, scientists are warning that time is running out. Communities around the world are experiencing climate change through extreme weather events. The least that can be done is to ensure that businesses, communities and individuals act in whatever way possible. The JSW-The Times of India 8th edition of Earth Care Awards (ECA) is calling on organisations, industries and individuals to apply for ECA awards by August 4, 2017.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC\'s) fifth assessment report had highlighted that India\'s agriculture sector will face the maximum impact of climate change. The report had also suggested that India will face an increase in both mean and extreme rainfall in  monsoon, floods and droughts are likely to increase and temperature variations could make disease outbreaks more frequent. In fact the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) recently said, "It is very likely that the number of cold days and nights has decreased and the number of warm days and nights has increased on the global scale. In large parts of Europe, Asia and Australia, it is likely that the frequency of heat waves has increased." This is why this time ECA is emphasizing on climate change mitigation and adaptation across sectors.\nThe awards will be in four categories: Community based mitigation and adaptation in water resources, agriculture, forestry and other land use, Innovations for climate protection, GHG Mitigation in large enterprises and Leadership in Urban Climate Action.\nThe Earth Care Awards (ECAs) were launched in 200708 and are jointly sponsored by JSW and The Times of India.The ECA aims to address miti gation and adaptation complexities at a larger level, and from 2012 the awards started reaching out to the SAARC region. Centre for Environment Education (CEE) has been the knowledge partner. The process is supported with a well-defined technical and methodological framework for assessment of GHG mitigation and adaptation parameters to define the evaluation process.\nCEE assists the Earth Care Jury in determining the criteria and evaluating the proposals through desk based review and field verification. From 2012, TERRE Policy Centre has also joined the ECA group as an outreach partner. For the 8th edition of the awards there is an eminent jury including RA Mashelkar, president, International Research Alliance; Kartikeya V Sarabhai, founder director, CEE; Rajendra Shende, chairperson, Terre; Aneeta Benninger, executive director, CDSA; Rajat Gupta, director, McKinsey; Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general, Centre for  Science and Environment (CSE) and Suhas Wani, director, ICRISAT Development Centre.\nThe ECA award includes a citation and a trophy . In the "community" and "innovation" categories, recipients of the awards are also given cash rewards, as decided by the jury.Those interested in applying can get more information at http:www.earthcareawards.com and download the ECA guidebook from the website.ECA is also on twitter @EarthCareAwards.\nLast year the Cochin International Airport and the Panaji City Corporation had won under "Leadership in urban climate action" category , Saguna Rural Foundation had won under "Innovations for climate protection," Nature Environment & Wildlife Society (NEWS) and Bangladeshbased PracticalAction had won under "Community based mitigation and adaptation in water resource, agriculture, forestry and other land use" category.\n'b"Every day, we see more evidence of climate change. Whether it is the rising oceans that are driving people out of their homes, rapidly increasing temperatures, or innocent animals being forced to flee their homes, it is clear that climate change is the number-one threat to mankind in this present day. \nAnd even worse, despite the massive amounts of evidence that we have accumulated that more than proves climate change, some completely naive folks have decided to literately stick their head in the sand and claim that it is a a hoax, or conspiracy theory. These people are clearly irrational, and I wonder what happened to them that makes them so blind to the truth. \nSomething that terrifies me even more, though, is that the president of the United States doesn't believe in climate change. This proves that he is not only a disgusting buffoon, but one who appears to be purposeful trying to destroy the environment in every way possible. Why else would he pull out of the Paris Agreement? \nHe doesn't gain anything from it, but it may cost others their well-being, or their lives. If he keeps up this path of destruction, it will only spur on his group of uneducated, white minions. If they see someone they look up to committing all of this violence and destruction, what will stop them from doing the same? They appear to blindly do anything that their leader does, so if they believe that hurting the environment has no negative repercussions, why wouldn't they just start to burn down forests, or wreck anything they please? \nThis is why climate change deniers are one of the most vile groups to ever walk on the surface of our beautiful Earth. I just hope that one day they open their eyes, and realize the evil that they are infatuated with is actually one of our greatest threats. \nLily Vanderbrider \nLethbridge\nCredit: Submitted Article\n"b'Trump to decide about climate change pact \nTHE CANADIAN PRESS [Eth] TAORMINA, Italy \nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau came out of the G7 summit Saturday calling it a success, even though the United States did not commit to the Paris climate accord. \n"Obviously, any new administration or any new government is going to have its own approach and its own priorities," Trudeau told reporters. "I think the value of the G7 is we do get to have honest and robust exchanges and talk about where we\'re going and how we\'re going to get there together." \nThe six-page final communique from the summit says six of the leaders, including Canada, agreed to stand by their commitment to implement the Paris Agreement. \n"We respect President Trump\'s choice to reflect further on their engagements around climate change and the Paris accord," Trudeau said. "But what I made very, very clear ... is that you cannot build a strong economic future for your citizens, for your country unless you are at the same time protecting and mindful of the environment." \nThe communique notes that the Americans are "not in a position to join consensus" on climate change. Shortly before the communique came out, Trump issued a tweet saying he would make his "final decision" on the Paris Agreement next week. \nThe G7 leaders have agreed to keep fighting protectionism, a win for the six countries that had been pushing Trump to come around to their view of free trade. \nThe leaders acknowledged Trump\'s stance on trade and the communique includes a statement that the leaders will keep markets open, but "stand firm against all unfair trade practices." \n"We commit to adopting appropriate policies so that all firms and citizens can make the most of opportunities offered by the global economy," it says. \nTrudeau and Trump also met for an informal chat on the sidelines of the summit. \nTrudeau told reporters that he and Trump have reaffirmed their commitment to the deep economic relationship between Canada and the U.S. \n"There\'s always opportunities to do more on trade, always opportunities to improve on trade deals," Trudeau said. "We certainly agreed that the benefits this relationship over time and into the future in creating good jobs, in creating economic growth on both sides of the border needs to be focused on and maintained." \nThe rules of the NAFTA countdown mean Trudeau and Trump cannot talk about specific issues that would be subject to negotiations, even though they did talk about Canada-U.S. trade, including softwood lumber. \nA Canadian government official who spoke to reporters about the 30-minute conversation between Trump and Trudeau on the condition of anonymity said that while the two leaders also spoke about international security, they did not discuss intelligence-sharing. \nG7 leaders also found agreement on other points, such as backing closer co-operation against terrorism after the concert bombing Monday in Manchester that killed 22 people. \n"We call upon all countries of the region to play a constructive role by contributing to efforts to achieve inclusive political solutions, reconciliation and peace, which are the only way to eradicate ISIL, other terrorist groups and violent extremism in the long-term in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and beyond," the communique says. \nTrudeau also went into the talks championing the benefits inclusive growth and gender equality, which are expected to be the main themes of the G7 summit that Canada is hosting in the Charlevoix region of Quebec next year. \nCanada played a leadership role in pushing for the communique to include the language on fighting protectionism, the Paris Agreement, and in particular for the reference to gender equality being "fundamental to the fulfillment of human rights," according to a federal government source. \nThe G7 is an informal gathering that meets every year under a rotating chairmanship. Its decisions are not binding as an international treaty would be, simply representing the leaders\' political commitment to carry through. \nThe G7 countries are Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Germany, the United States and the UK.

And we should do what we can to be prepared, because similar events could happen here. \nAs we have seen in Alberta and British Columbia, fires can turn into dangerous catastrophes in very short time, threatening people, wildlife and property. \nLast summer in Atlantic Canada was hot and dry. Bans on burning and campfires were widespread. Conditions this year are more moderate so far, but a prolonged dry spell could make things very dangerous, very quickly. \nThere are two events at play in Western Canada. Fort McMurray has a key role in Alberta's oilsands industry [Eth] a contributing factor in climate change. The disaster that razed much of Fort McMurray last year makes it imperative to recognize the connection between human-influenced climate change and wildfires. \nThe Fort McMurray inferno, which broke out May 1, 2016, was the worst and costliest wildfire in Canadian history. It forced the evacuation of approximately 90,000 people, destroyed thousands of homes and buildings and forced the shutdown of oil sands operations. \nThe fire spread across approximately 590,000 hectares [Eth] an area larger than Prince Edward Island [Eth] before it was brought under control. Man likely started the fire, but the conditions were directly related to climate change. An unusually hot, dry air mass was in place over Northern Alberta that month, which brought record-setting temperatures to Fort McMurray, hitting over 32 C for days, along with high winds and low humidity. It was a recipe for disaster. \nB.C. has declared a state of emergency this month as more than 200 wildfires burn across that province. \nIronically, B.C. is partly responsible for its heightened forest fire threat. The province has been so successful at putting out wildfires in recent decades that denser forests have developed, with a lot of dead material on the ground. Now, when the province has increasingly regular hot, dry weather, wildfires are much more severe. \nB.C. tried to protect its forests from wildfires, but instead created a situation where they're much more susceptible and the fires are more damaging. \nAnd fire-friendly weather conditions, once considered the exception, will soon become average, based on climate change predictions. \nEastern provinces are taking some action. For example, this week, Newfoundland and Labrador unveiled a new tool to help stop forest fires before they start [Eth] an online forest fire hazard map that provides real-time information about the risk of wildfires throughout the province. \nHot, dry weather patterns are projected to occur longer and earlier in B.C, Alberta and elsewhere in the country. We must take steps to combat climate change, and to manage our forests more wisely and safely. \nIf not, it could be us having to sound the alarm. \nAn editorial from the Amherst News (distributed by The Canadian Press)\nCredit: Transporter\n"b'Spring flooding in Canada this year upended lives, inundated city streets and swamped houses, prompting calls for sandbags, seawalls and dikes to save communities. \nOntario and Quebec\'s April rainfall was double the 30-year average. \nThousands of homes in 130 Quebec municipalities stretching from the Ontario border to the Gasp? Peninsula flooded in May. Montreal residents raced to protect their homes and families as three dikes gave way and the city declared a state of emergency. \nThe Ontario government had to boost its resources for an emergency flood response. \nIn Atlantic Canada, some parts of New Brunswick recorded more than 150 millimetres of rain during a nearly 36-hour, non-stop downpour. In B.C.\'s Okanagan, rapidly melting snowpack and swelling creeks caused lake levels  to rise to record heights. The City of West Kelowna declared a state of emergency and evacuated homes. \nFloods have become one of the most visible signs of the effects of climate change in cities, towns and rural areas throughout Canada. \nSpring floods aren\'t unusual, but the intensity and frequency of recent rains are breaking records. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the leading international body for climate change assessment, anticipates  a significant increase in heavy precipitation events and flooding in many parts of the world, including Canada. \nWhen temperatures rise, the atmosphere carries more moisture so when it rains, it dumps. The Insurance Bureau of Canada found one in five Canadians  faces some level of flood risk, and 1.8 million households are at very high risk. \nClimate change-related events - including floods, drought and fires - are a drain on personal finances and the economy. \nWith more than 80 significant floods in Canada since 2000, insurance costs are skyrocketing. The  2013 Alberta floods alone costEmore than $6 billion. Canadians personally shoulder about $600 million each year in losses related to flooding. \nAround the world, insurers have paid out more than $200 billion over the past decade in claims for damages caused  by coastal floods. \nDeforestation, wetland destruction and artificial shoreline projects worsen the problem. Insurance agencies recognize that, compared to expensive infrastructure, keeping ecosystems healthy prevents climate disasters, saves money and improves resiliency. \nLloyd\'s of London encourages insurers to consider the value of natural coastal habitats when pricing flood risk. One study found ecosystems such as wetlands are more effective than seawalls in protecting against coastal storms. Insurers say conserving nature is about 30 times cheaper than building seawalls. \nStill, many jurisdictions focus on engineered structures such as rock walls or even giant sea gates for coastal flooding, dams and levees to hold back rivers, and draining to prevent wetlands from overflowing. But built  infrastructure costs cash-strapped municipalities money, requires more maintenance and is less flexible than keeping natural areas intact. \nUrban concrete and asphalt surfaces prevent water from infiltrating into the ground and increase storm-water runoff. Rain gardens, bioswales and permeable pavements better manage flooding by reducing runoff and protecting  flood plains and foreshore areas. \nNature absorbs rainfall and prevents excess water from overwhelming pipe networks, backing up sewers and pooling in streets and basements. Restored river channels, parkways and beaches reduce costs, add valued amenities, increase  access to nature and improve community health. \nMany local governments are trying to keep up by limiting development in flood zones, better managing flood plains and updating flood-management systems. \nSome, such as Gibsons, B.C., are using a new approach that considers nature as a vital part of the town\'s infrastructure and puts "natural capital" assets on equal footing with built assets. \nThe Municipal Natural Assets Initiative helps local governments across Canada test this approach by giving them tools to identify and  account for community natural assets and improve management. \nThe federal government has set aside $2 billion to help local governments defend against natural disasters like fire and flooding. \nIt should allocate a significant portion to natural infrastructure solutions. This would  create the foundation for a national study of how much natural infrastructure contributes to biodiversity conservation, economic productivity and climate change mitigation and adaptation. \nDespite recent investments, Canada lags behind other G7 nations in flood preparation and climate change adaptation. It\'s time we recognized the importance of intact nature and built green infrastructure as central to flood-prevention efforts. \nNature can help us - if we let it. \nDavid Suzuki is a scientist, broadcaster and author.\n'b'A majority of scientists might say a scientific theory is true, but that doesn\'t mean the consensus is reliable. The science underpinning environmental claims can be fundamentally wrong--as it was in one of the biggest environmental scares in recent decades.\nThe acid-rain alarm of the 1970s and \'80s was a dry run for the current panic about climate change. Both began in Sweden as part of a war on coal meant to bolster support for nuclear power. In 1971 meteorologist Bert Bolin wrote the Swedish government\'s report on acid rain to the United Nations. Seventeen years later he became the first chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nThere are many parallels between acid rain and global warming. Each phenomenon produced a U.N. convention--the 1979 Geneva Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution in the case of acid rain, and the 1988 Framework Convention on Climate Change. And each convention led to a new protocol--the 1985 Helsinki Protocol and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Public alarm surrounding acid rain was far more intense, especially in Germany, where popular reaction to media stories about acid rain reached a pitch of hysteria not yet seen with global warming. A 1981 Der Speigel cover story  featured an image of smokestacks looming over a copse of trees with the title "The Forest Is Dying."\nThe most striking parallels are the role of scientific consensus in underpinning environmental alarm and the way science is used to justify cuts in emissions. The emission of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere "has proved to be a major environmental problem," Bolin wrote in his 1971 report. National scientific academies across North America and Europe were in complete agreement. "We have a much more complete knowledge of the causes and consequences of acid deposition than we have for other pollutants," a report by the National Academy of Sciences\' National Research Council said in 1981. According to the NRC, the circumstantial evidence was "overwhelming." Many thousands of lakes had been affected, rivers were losing salmon, fisheries in the Adirondacks were in a bad way, red spruce were dying, and production from Canadian sugar maple trees had been affected. Acid rain was a scientific slam dunk.\nPoliticians duly parroted what the scientists told them. "Acid rain has caused serious environmental damage in many parts of the world," President Jimmy Carter wrote  in his 1979 environmental message to Congress. He signed an agreement with Canada to establish five acid-rain working groups, and Congress set up a 10-year National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program, which went by the catchy acronym Napap.\nTo Canadian anger, President Ronald Reagan was more skeptical than his predecessor. The head of Canada\'s Federal Assessment and Review Office accused Mr. Reagan of "blatant efforts to manipulate" the science being done by the working groups. A formal note of protest from Ottawa pointed to the more than 3,000 scientific studies on acid rain yielding "sufficient scientific evidence" for policies to cut emissions.\nVice President George Bush promised Canada that if elected president, he would act on the problem. But as acid-rain cap-and-trade legislation was making its way through Congress, the Environmental Protection Agency encountered a major problem. Napap\'s draft report concluded that the science was wrong. Yes, power-station emissions make rain more acidic--rain is naturally acidic, and more so during thunderstorms--but changes to ecosystems, the report said, were mainly caused by changes in land use. The felling of trees and the burning of stumps in the Adirondacks had reduced the acidity of the forest floor. After conservationists put a stop to it, the soil gradually returned to its previous acidity.\nRather than admit it had the science wrong, the EPA set about suppressing the inconvenient findings. The Napap report was delayed until after key provisions of cap-and-trade legislation had been agreed to in Congress. As outlined in a 1992 article  in Reason, the EPA then waged a dirty-tricks campaign to discredit Edward C. Krug, a soil expert and the leading dissident Napap scientist. It assembled a group of compliant scientists to conduct a sham peer review and conclude that Mr. Krug was a bad scientist. The episode ended with an assistant administrator of the EPA, William Rosenberg, apologizing to Mr. Krug to avoid a threatened libel action.\nTo this day, the zombie science of acid rain lives on at the EPA\'s website , which falsely states that acidification of soil, streams and lakes is caused by emissions from power stations. The EPA reckons  the annual cost of anti-acid-rain measures in the U.S. will reach $65 billion in 2020, but it no longer claims that the money will prevent ecosystem damage. Now it just claims to be improving public health.\nIn its approach to the science of global warming, the EPA under current Administrator Scott Pruitt couldn\'t offer a greater contrast with the acid-rain coverup perpetrated by the EPA during the late \'80s and early \'90s. Instead of attacking dissident scientists, Mr. Pruitt\'s proposal to hold red-team/blue-team appraisals would put dissenters on the same footing as consensus-supporting scientists. This will enable proper debate between both camps to reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the scientific consensus on global warming.\nOpen debate is as crucial to science as it is to democracy. Capping sulfur-dioxide emissions is an economic pinprick compared with the multitrillion-dollar cost of cutting emissions of carbon dioxide. If people\'s way of life is to be forcibly changed in an expensive attempt to decarbonize society, at the very least it should be done with their informed consent.\nMr. Darwall is author of "Green Tyranny: Exposing the Totalitarian Roots of the Climate Industrial Complex" (Encounter, 2017).\nCredit: By Rupert Darwall\n'b"The Canadian Press \nAn Arctic climate change study has been cancelled because warming temperatures have filled the sea off northern Newfoundland with hazardous ice. \nDavid Barber, the expedition's chief scientist, says the Coast Guard icebreaker researchers were on had to focus on rescuing fishing boats and helping other ships stuck in ice as much as eight metres thick. \nBarber says the ice from the High Arctic is much further south than usual and conditions are the worst he has seen in 35 years. \nThe scientists were hoping to study the effect of climate change on sea ice in Hudson Bay. \nBarber says the cancellation is ironic because climate change is what caused the thick sea ice to travel so far south. \nHe says such hazardous conditions will happen more often and Canada needs to be more prepared for the effects of climate change.\nCredit: Sender_2\n"b'The executive orders on climate change President Trump signed this week represent a step in the right direction for U.S. energy policy and, importantly, deliver on Mr. Trump\'s campaign promise to roll back burdensome regulations affecting American companies. But it will take more than the stroke of a pen to make lasting progress and reverse the momentum of the climate-change movement.\nOn Tuesday, in a series of orders, Mr. Trump instructed the Environmental Protection Agency to rework its Clean Power Plan, which would restrict carbon emissions from existing power plants, mainly coal-fired ones. Last year the U.S. Supreme Court stayed enforcement of the CPP pending judicial review.\nMr. Trump also directed the Interior Department to lift its current moratorium on federal coal leasing and loosen restrictions on oil and gas development (including methane flaring) on federal lands. And he instructed all government agencies to stop factoring climate change into the environmental-review process for federal projects. The federal government will recalculate the "social cost of carbon."\nThese actions are a good start, but all they do is reverse many of the executive orders President Obama signed late in his second term. While easy to implement and theatrical to stage, such measures are largely superficial and may prove as temporary as the decrees they rescind.\nBecause they don\'t attack the climate-change regulatory problem at its root, Mr. Trump\'s orders will not provide enough clarity to U.S. energy companies--particularly electric utilities and coal-mining companies--for their long-term business forecasting or short-term capital investment and head-count planning.\nTo accomplish that, the Trump administration, led by EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, needs to target the EPA\'s 2009 "endangerment finding," which labeled carbon dioxide as a pollutant. That foundational ruling provided the legal underpinnings for all of the EPA\'s follow-on carbon regulations, including the CPP.\nIt also provided the rationale for the previous administration\'s anti-fossil-fuel agenda and its various climate-change initiatives and programs, which spanned more than a dozen federal agencies and cost the American taxpayer roughly $20 billion to $25 billion a year during Mr. Obama\'s presidency.\nThe endangerment finding was the product of a rush to judgment. Much of the scientific data upon which it was predicated--chiefly, the 2007 Fourth Assessment Report of the U.N.\'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change--was already dated by the time of its publication and arguably not properly peer-reviewed as federal law requires.\nWith the benefit of hindsight--including more than a decade of actual-versus-modeled data, plus the insights into the insular climate-science community gleaned from the University of East Anglia Climategate email disclosures--there would seem to be strong grounds now to reconsider the EPA\'s 2009 decision and issue a new finding.\nIn 2013, the IPCC issued a more circumspect Fifth Assessment Report, which noted a hiatus in global warming since 1998 and a breakdown in correlation between the world\'s average surface temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, causing the U.N. body to revise down its 2007 projections for the rate of planetary warming over the first half of the 21st century.\nAlthough this initially reported "pause" was subsequently eliminated through the downward manipulation of historical temperature data, this latest IPCC assessment calls into question both the predictive power and input data quality of most global climate models, and further highlights the scientific uncertainty surrounding the basic premise of anthropogenic climate change.\nAn updated EPA endangerment finding based on an objective review of the latest available scientific data is warranted, along with a more sober discussion of the threat posed by carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to the "public health and welfare of current and future generations," in the words of the original endangerment finding.\nAs long as the 2009 finding remains on the books, it will provide legal ammunition for environmentalists, academics and state government officials seeking to sue the administration for any actions related to climate change, including this week\'s executive orders.\nIssuing a new endangerment finding would be a bold move requiring thorough work, but the Trump EPA would be well within its legal rights to undertake such an updated review process. In Massachusetts v. EPA (2007), the Supreme Court ruled that the Clean Air Act gives the EPA the authority, but not the obligation, to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The EPA needs to "ground its reasons for action or inaction" with "reasoned judgment" and scientific analysis.\nAddressing the 2009 endangerment finding head-on would show that Mr. Trump is serious about challenging climate-change orthodoxy. Thus far he has sent a mixed message, as demonstrated by this week\'s ambivalence on CPP (reworking rather than repealing) and his administration\'s silence on U.S. participation in the U.N.\'s 2015 Paris Agreement.\nSimply standing down on regulatory enforcement, cutting government funding for climate-change research and stopping data collection for the next four years will not suffice. Ignoring the EPA\'s 2009 endangerment finding would mean that it is only a matter of time before another liberal-minded occupant of the White House reasserts this regulatory power, bringing the country and the domestic energy sector back where Mr. Obama left them.\nMr. Tice is an executive-in-residence at New York University\'s Stern School of Business and a former Wall Street energy research analyst.\nCredit: By Paul H.

Since the developed countries have to show pre-2020 actions and get them reviewed in 2018 and 2019, the issue will get reflected as \'decision\' of this conference.\nIt is expected that the 2018 facilitative dialogue -- called Talanoa dialogue -- will discuss pre-2020 actions of rich nations apart from looking at the climate actions of all nations under the Paris Agreement. Under the draft text, all countries will be asked by the COP president to ratify the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol "as soon as possible".\nIt is agreed that a periodic stocktaking on pre-2020 implementation will take place at COP24 in 2018 and COP25 in 2019. The rich nations will have to submit the pre-2020 actions they have taken by May 1, 2018.\n"The lost agenda in climate change negotiations at COP23 on ambitious pre-2020 mitigation action by developed countries was redeemed with efforts by India, China and other developing countries," said India\'s environment secretary C K Mishra.\nHe said: "Many of the proposals floated by India as part of the Like Minded Developing Countries group were agreed upon by the COP presidency and found a place in the draft decision text."\nFor full report, log on to www.timesofindia.com\nClimate protesters invoke goddess\nCarrying placards and banners in protest against coal use and fracking, civil society members, including activists from India and Pakistan, on Wednesday invoked Goddess Kali as they urged the world to unite in defeating the \'demon\' of fossil fuel-based pollution.

The reality is that withdrawing is in America\'s economic interest and won\'t matter much to the climate.\nPresident Obama signed the agreement last September, albeit by ducking the two-thirds majority vote in the Senate required under the Constitution for such national commitments. The pact includes a three-year process for withdrawal, which Mr. Trump could short-circuit by also pulling out of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\nParis was supposed to address the failures of the 1997 Kyoto protocol, which Bill Clinton signed but George W. Bush refused to implement amid similar outrage. The Kyoto episode is instructive because the U.S. has since reduced emissions faster than much of Europe thanks to business innovation -- namely, hydraulic fracturing that is replacing coal with natural gas.\nWhile legally binding, Kyoto\'s CO2 emissions targets weren\'t strictly enforced. European countries that pursued aggressive reductions were engaging in economic masochism. According to a 2014 Manhattan Institute study, the average cost of residential electricity in 2012 was 12 cents per kilowatt hour in the U.S. but an average 26 cents in the European Union and 35 cents in Germany. The average price of electricity in the EU soared 55% from 2005 to 2013.\nYet Germany\'s emissions have increased in the last two years as more coal is burned to compensate for reduced nuclear energy and unreliable solar and wind power. Last year coal made up 40% of Germany\'s power generation compared to 30% for renewables, while state subsidies to stabilize the electric grid have grown five-fold since 2012.\nBut the climate believers tried again in Paris, this time with goals that are supposedly voluntary. China and India offered benchmarks pegged to GDP growth, which means they can continue their current energy plans. China won\'t even begin reducing emissions until 2030 and in the next five years it will use more coal.\nPresident Obama, meanwhile, committed the U.S. to reducing emissions by between 26% and 28% below 2005 levels by 2025. This would require extreme changes in energy use. Even Mr. Obama\'s bevy of anti-carbon regulations would get the U.S. to a mere 45% of its target.\nMeeting the goals would require the Environmental Protection Agency to impose stringent emissions controls on vast stretches of the economy including steel production, farm soil management and enteric fermentation (i.e., cow flatulence). Don\'t laugh -- California\'s Air Resources Board is issuing regulations to curb bovine burping to meet its climate goals.\nAdvocates in the White House for remaining in Paris claim the U.S. has the right to unilaterally reduce Mr. Obama\'s emissions commitments. They say stay in and avoid the political meltdown while rewriting the U.S. targets.\nBut Article 4, paragraph 11 of the accord says "a party may at any time adjust its existing nationally determined contribution with a view to enhancing its level of ambition." There is no comparable language permitting a reduction in national targets.\nRest assured that the Sierra Club and other greens will sue under the Section 115 "international air pollution" provision of the Clean Air Act to force the Trump Administration to enforce the Paris standards. The "voluntary" talk will vanish amid the hunt for judges to rule that Section 115 commands the U.S. to reduce emissions that "endanger" foreign countries if those countries reciprocate under Paris. After his experience with the travel ban, Mr. Trump should understand that legal danger.\n---\nThe Big Con at the heart of Paris is that even its supporters concede that meeting all of its commitments won\'t prevent more than a 0.17 degree Celsius increase in global temperatures by 2100, far less than the two degrees that is supposedly needed to avert climate doom.\nIt\'s also rich for Europeans to complain about the U.S. abdicating climate leadership after their regulators looked the other way as auto makers, notably Volkswagen, cheated on emissions tests. This allowed Europeans to claim they were meeting their green goals without harming the competitiveness of their auto makers. The EPA had to shame the EU into investigating the subterfuge.\nThe U.S. legal culture will insist on carbon compliance even if Europe and China cheat. Even if Mr. Trump would succeed in rewriting U.S. emissions targets, his predecessor could ratchet them back up. That possibility might deter some companies from investing in long-term fossil-fuel production.\nThe simplest decision is to make a clean break from Paris. But if Mr. Trump doesn\'t want to take the political heat for withdrawing on his own, here\'s a compromise: Atone for Mr. Obama\'s dereliction and submit Paris to the Senate for approval as a treaty. Then we can see whether anticarbon virtue-signaling beats real-world economic costs for Democrats from energy states like Heidi Heitkamp (North Dakota), Joe Manchin (West Virginia) and Joe Donnelly (Indiana).\n(See related letters: "Letters to the Editor: Leaving Paris: Good Move or Terrible Error?" -- WSJ June 7, 2017)\n'b'The business case for the Paris agreement has nothing to do with climate change. It goes like this: It is better to be part of any confab than outside of it. Like saluting the flag or bowing your head in church, there is no cost to being insincere, but there is a cost to not going along.\nLet us understand something: 195 countries will not be dragged kicking and screaming to sign any agreement that imposes a cost on them. Such deals exist only because they provide an international imprimatur to what politicians were going to do anyway.\nThe oil countries like Saudi Arabia and Norway signed. They plan to keep producing oil. India and China plan to grow energy consumption until it is similar to the per capita consumption of the developed countries, at which point it will level off.\nThe U.S. and Europe intend to keep subsidizing green energy as long as domestic voters give them permission to do so, because the whole point of being in office is to redirect resources to interest groups best able to reward politicians for doling out the goodies.\nThe Paris countries agreed to meet certain emissions targets, and claimed an intent to hold a planetary temperature increase to less than 2 degrees Celsius.\nNot only are the emission targets unenforceable, they have no intelligible relation to the temperature goal according to the very iffy science. By the shot-in-the-dark estimates of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, it\'s even possible the rest of the century will bring little warming anyway.\nAnd that\'s good. Because the unenforceable cuts agreed to in Paris would be a rounding error even if carried out.\nIn the 30 years since global warming became a daily concern of the newspapers, one lesson has been reliably demonstrated for policy participants: There is no appetite in the body politic for the kinds of energy taxes and prohibitions needed to make a meaningful change in atmospheric CO2.\nWe won\'t dwell on the media hysteria since the Trump decision, or why many of you, dear readers, in defiance of your own reason, will participate in the hysteria even when you know better. Human beings are social animals. When a mob is forming, we experience high anxiety if we\'re not part of it.\nAgreements like Paris arguably aim at the wrong target anyway. Only when technology can meet mankind\'s energy demand at competitive cost will low-carbon energy prevail. Governments would be wise to invest in basic energy research rather than throwing money at energy technologies that are viable only as long as the subsidies keep flowing. But the latter is what brings in the political bacon.\nOh well. Hypocrisy is the universal solvent of social relations. This also explains the other big climate story of the day, which reporters have given themselves hypoxia trying to inflate the significance of. We\'re referring to the vote by 62% of Exxon shareholders, led by giant funds Vanguard, Fidelity and BlackRock, to ask the company to explain how the Paris temperature target would affect its business.\nFor 30 years there has been push-and-pull in politics over climate change. During every nanosecond of that time, at least while markets were open, investors were repricing energy shares in light of the possibility of climate change legislation.\nExxon has nothing new or useful to tell investors in this regard. Would a carbon tax be good for bad for the company? It would accelerate the displacement of coal by natural gas, which Exxon produces. Is an electric-car battery in the offing that would go 300 miles and be rechargeable in a five-minute stop at a charging station? Probably not. In which case, even a sizable carbon tax would be unlikely to make much dent in the 8% of global emissions caused by passenger cars. Americans bought 143 billion gallons of gas last year when the price was $2.25; they bought 133 billion gallons in 2012 when the price was $3.64.\n"Our patience is not infinite," huffed a statement by BlackRock, the $5.4 trillion Wall Street fund, as it voted for Exxon\'s climate penance.\nThis gesture, of surpassing meaninglessness, is a case of one prominent institution trying to buff up its reputation for church attendance at the expense of another.\nAnd yet, regardless of Mr. Trump\'s Paris decision, only one large national economy has been reporting sizable emissions declines, thanks to fracking. The same economy may soon also be able to take credit for slowing China\'s prodigious emissions growth thanks to natural gas exports to displace Chinese coal. That country is the U.S. under the unthinkable monster Donald Trump. Whatever evolution toward a lower-carbon energy system takes place in the future, it will also certainly be driven overwhelmingly by technology and markets, not policy.\nCredit: By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr.\n'b'Activists, journalists and scientists have pounced on the still-unfolding disaster in Houston and along the Gulf Coast in an attempt to focus the policy discussion narrowly on climate change. Such single-issue myopia takes precious attention away from policies that could improve our ability to prepare for and respond to disasters. More thoughtful and effective disaster policies are needed because the future will bring many more weather disasters like Hurricane Harvey, with larger impacts than those of the recent past.\nFor many years, those seeking to justify carbon restrictions argued that hurricanes had become more common and intense. That hasn\'t happened. Scientific assessments, including those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the U.S. government\'s latest National Climate Assessment, indicate no long-term increases in the frequency or strength of hurricanes in the U.S. Neither has there been an increase in floods, droughts and tornadoes, though heat waves and heavy precipitation have become more common.\nPrior to Harvey, which made landfall as a Category 4 storm, the U.S. had gone a remarkable 12 years without being hit by a hurricane of Category 3 strength or stronger. Since 1970 the U.S. has only seen four hurricanes of Category 4 or 5 strength. In the previous 47 years, the country was struck by 14 such storms.\nPresident Obama presided over the lowest rate of hurricane landfalls -- 0.5 a year -- of any president since at least 1900. Eight presidents dealt with more than two a year, but George W. Bush (18 storms) is the only one to have done so since Lyndon B. Johnson. The rest occurred before 1960.\nWithout data to support their wilder claims, climate partisans have now resorted to shouting that every extreme weather event was somehow "made worse" by the emission of greenhouse gases. Last week New York Times columnist David Leonhardt directed researchers "to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather."\nTurning away from empirical science -- or "fussy over-precision" -- comes with risks. But whatever one\'s views on climate, there should be broad agreement today that bigger disasters are coming. Some may blame greenhouse gases, while others may believe it to be some sort of karmic retribution.\nBut there is a simpler explanation: Because the world has experienced a remarkable period of good fortune when it comes to catastrophes, we are due.\nAgreement that more big disasters are on their way should provide opportunity for those otherwise opposed on matters of climate policy to come together and make some smart decisions. Here is where they might start:\n-- Establish disaster review boards. In the aftermath of every plane crash, the U.S. government convenes experts under the auspices of the National Transportation Safety Board to find out what went wrong and what might be done to prevent it from happening again. Meteorologist Michael Smith of AccuWeather (a scientist who decades ago helped identify the "microburst" weather phenomena and its role in plane crashes) has long argued that the nation needs a National Disaster Review Board. After every disaster, it would evaluate what went wrong -- and right -- and distill lessons. The Trump administration should create such a board in the wake of Harvey.\n-- Encourage resilient growth. Disaster researcher Dennis Mileti has explained that the choices made at the local level -- such as where to build -- determine how a community will experience disasters. As communities develop, it can be difficult to see how local decisions might affect disasters years or decades down the road. This is particularly the case in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, when the push to "return to normal" might mean simply reinforcing the conditions that led to problems. Local communities need to take better advantage of experts who can explore development choices with an eye toward better preparing for an uncertain future.\n-- Enhance federal capacity. The federal government plays a crucial role in supporting states and local communities to prepare for, respond to and recover from disasters. When Harvey was out at sea, accurate forecasts from the National Weather Service saved many lives. The National Flood Insurance Program shapes how communities develop, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other agencies provide resources for those whose lives are upturned by natural disasters. President Trump should also appoint a science adviser, whose primary job traditionally has been to coordinate federal science agencies, facilitate budget requests and assess performance. There is no reason to go more than seven months without one.\nThe hyperpoliticized debate over climate change sees the same tiresome script play out with every extreme event. We needn\'t all agree on the reasons why disasters will assuredly get worse in the coming years in order to come together to make sensible decisions about disaster policies. The time is now. Our good luck appears to have run out.\n---\nMr. Pielke is a professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

Wildfires that began in early April scorched just over 12,000 square kilometres of timber, bush and grassland and at their height forced 45,000 people from their homes. \nLast month, Waterton Lakes National Park was evacuated after lightning sparked a blaze just inside the B.C. boundary. The flames eventually crossed into the park in southwestern Alberta. \nAnd this last week, wind-whipped grass fires quickly spread and threatened communities in a swath stretching from the Crowsnest Pass in southwestern Alberta all the way into Saskatchewan. \nThe phenomenon isn\'t just in Western Canada, says Mike Flannigan, a professor of wildland fire at the University of Alberta. He points out fires around the world this year have been "head and shoulders above the previous record." \n"There\'s been deadly fires and historic fires in Chile, Portugal N twice N and California," Flannigan said in an interview. \n"It\'s been quite a devastating year globally and the California fires will be the most expensive ... (with) tens of billions in losses." \nFlannigan said human-caused climate change isn\'t the root cause of fires, but has made them much worse. Global warming has made conditions more favourable for intense flames. \n"With warmer temperatures, the fuels will be drier, and when a fire goes through, there\'s more fuel to consume," he said. \n"It makes it more extreme. Winds are a little stronger, the temperatures are a little higher and it\'s a little drier." \nFlannigan said warmer temperatures also spawn an increase in lightning activity. For every degree the temperature rises, there\'s a 12 per cent increase in lightning. \nFires have certainly increased in the last several decades, he said. \n"The amount of fire activity in Canada, which currently is about 2 1/2 million hectares N about half the size of Nova Scotia N has doubled since the 1970s." \nThe Insurance Bureau of Canada has been watching weather trends with a wary eye. \n"The whole issue of climate change and the severe weather that results from it has been discussed for years ... but really in the last decade we\'ve just seen an explosion in the incidents and the severity of these extreme weather events," said Bill Adams, the Insurance Bureau of Canada\'s western vice-president. \n"It\'s really a continuation of what we\'ve seen for many years where the traditional weather patterns that we\'ve grown up with ... we can\'t rely on them any longer." \nAdams said disasters in Alberta have accounted for about 70 per cent of all claims paid out in the last eight years. Fires, floods and hail account for most. \n"There\'s no question that Alberta has been the epicentre in the Canadian context of the majority of the severe weather events in the last number of years."\nCredit: Sender_2\n'b'Toronto city council has adopted a climate action plan setting out a road map that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent by 2050. \nIt calls for a 65 per cent reduction in community-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 from 1990 levels and for all new buildings to be near zero emissions by that date. \nThe city also aims to have all existing buildings retrofitted to the highest emission reduction technically feasible, while limiting affordability impacts to residents, by 2050. \nThe Toronto Environmental Alliance calls the retrofitting of every building in Toronto by 2050 a bold action. \nSpokeswoman Dusha Sritharan says if done properly, the plan will create good local jobs and make life more affordable, especially for residents in social housing. \nToronto\'s climate plan will require $6.7 million in new funding in 2018 to get started. \n"Now that the climate plan is adopted, we need to make sure it is put into action," said Sritharan. "That\'s why we will be looking carefully at the city\'s 2018 budget to make sure the $6.7 million is there to begin building a greener and more prosperous city."\nCredit: Transporter\n'b'No Is Not Enough: Resisting the New Shock Politics and Winning the World We Need By Naomi Klein Knopf Canada, 274 pages, $24.95\nBasically, the instant after Donald Trump issued his intent to backpedal out of the Paris climate accord, salvation emerged in the likeliest of places. Mega-billionaire and former mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg barely missed a beat, offering to personally foot the $15-million bill accounting for the U.S.\'s financial commitment to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\nIt\'s the sort of widely publicized, good Samaritan selflessness that wealthy benefactors such as Bloomberg excel at. And, on paper, it seems to address the climate calamity Trump is inviting in ducking out of the Paris agreement. Where the state fails, private capital succeeds - like a smiling, self-sufficient firefighter saving a cat that has been marooned in a tall tree by some feckless government bureaucrat.\nAnd yet Bloomberg\'s ostensible do-goodery suggests an emerging future of billionaire versus billionaire, vying for the hearts and minds of the American people, and the fate of planet itself. It\'s like a scene out of one of those old Japanese monster movies: two towering behemoths clobbering each other with pointyedged briefcases full of money, while way down below, normal, everyday people dash around in a blind panic, watching helplessly as their homes, places of business and their very livelihoods are pitilessly stomped on.\nAuthor and activist Naomi Klein disparages the Bloombergian "billionaire-as-saviour complex" midway through No Is Not Enough, her new, pamphlet-sized (by the standards of Klein\'s previous tomes, anyway) analysis of the early days of the Trump administration. "Elite liberals have been looking to the billionaire class to solve the problems we used to address with collective action and a strong public sector," she writes. "Trump\'s assertion that he knows how to fix America because he\'s rich is nothing more than an uncouth, vulgar echo of a dangerous idea we have been hearing for years: that Bill Gates can fix Africa. Or that Richard Branson and Michael Bloomberg can solve climate change."\nKlein has no use for such champions: the philanthrocapitalists, the Davos Class, the green messiahs (a term she deployed in her previous book, This Changes Everything). Her focus in No Is Not Enough remains the vociferous advocacy for grassroots, popular political movements that can meaningfully push back against Donald Trump, and the governing political-economic logic of neo-liberalism more generally.\nWeighed against her back catalogue of contemporary progressive-leftie doctrine - 2000\'s No Logo, 2007\'s The Shock Doctrine and 2014\'s This Changes Everything constitute a kind of holy trinity of popular 21st-century leftism - No Is Not Enough is a slight, seemingly rushed-to-market book, birthed from a sense of expectation and obligation, a feeling that Naomi Klein should weigh in on Trump. "I\'ve come to realize," she writes in her introduction, "that the research I\'ve done over the years can help shed some light on crucial aspects of Trumpism."\nNo Is Not Enough constitutes a greatest hits compilation for Klein, which grinds Trump\'s presidency (and the larger phenomenon around it) through any number of the author\'s ideas: branding, shock, disaster capitalism, culture jamming, etc.\nFor anyone familiar with Klein\'s work, such connections may seem patently obvious, and maybe even a little boring (a dissection of Trump\'s hollow branding of his name and persona feels a bit academic in the present moment of crisis). But anyone struggling for a place to even start making sense of Trump, and Trumpism, will find a book abounding in insight.\nAs Klein puts it, her driving thesis is "that Trump, extreme as he is, is less an aberration than a logical conclusion - a pastiche of pretty much all the worst trends of the past half century." Like any serious socialist thinker, Klein knows that to meaningfully understand Trump, one needs to understand his emergence from a material-historical tangle of politics, economics and celebrity culture. To this last point, Klein develops an image of Donald Trump as an embodiment of "capitalist burlesque," manifested on his hit reality show The Apprentice, and even his appearances as himself in pro wrestling broadcasts. She is shrewd and savvy enough to understand that Trump is a product of a system, that a "billionaire president who boasts he can grab women by their genitals while calling Mexicans \'rapists\' and jeering at the disabled is the logical expression of a culture that grants indecent levels of impunity to the ultrarich, that is consumed with winner-take-all competition, and that is grounded in dominancebased logic at every level."\nAs far as how to reorient such a culture, and jam up this system, Klein has a few handy prescriptions. Among them: undermining Trump\'s boss-man brand by making him look like a puppet (she talks specifically about Trump\'s fury at being trolled with the #PresidentBannon hashtag, resulting in altright strategist Steve Bannon being canned from his National Security Council post), moving toward energy-efficiency and universal basic income, and devoting more time to "face-toface relationships," as a way of encouraging political mobilization among the left by fostering a sense of common interests/ goals. (No Is Not Enough also reprints 2015\'s "Leap Manifesto," a practical, ends-oriented guide to shifting the "political zeitgeist.") Despite the horrific realities of modern political life, in America and around the world, Klein retains a certain optimism. Per her thesis that major crises precipitate political change (whether good or bad), she seizes on the shock of Trump as such an opportunity. For her, Occupy Wall Street, the Arab Spring, the ascent of galvanizing also-rans such as Bernie Sanders or even the widespread demystifying of the word "neo-liberalism" in the media mark "the first tremors of a profound ideological realignment from which the progressive majority could well emerge - just as geopolitically significant as the rise of authoritarianism and neo-fascism on the right side of the spectrum."\nWithout lapsing into corny cheeriness or the puffed-up cant of centrist political clich ("Love Trumps Hate!"), Naomi Klein holds out a cautious hope for the despairing age: an honest, prescriptive belief that people can unite in their opposition to Trumpism to build a better world.\nIn her closing chapter, Klein cites Belgian cartoonist JeanClaude Servais, in what stands as a meaningful mission statement for No Is Not Enough and the oppositional movement it hopes to marshal: "The hour calls for optimism; we\'ll save pessimism for better times."\nJohn Semley is the author of This is a Book About the Kids in the Hall and a regular contributor to Globe Books.\n'b'As soon as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma made landfall in the U.S., scientists, politicians and journalists began to discuss the role of climate change in natural disasters. Although a clear scientific consensus has emerged over the past decade that climate change influences hurricanes in the long run, its effect upon any individual storm is unclear. Anyone trying to score political points after a natural disaster should take a deep breath and review the science first.\nAs a meteorologist with access to the best weather-forecast model data available, I watched each hurricane\'s landfall with particular interest. Harvey and Irma broke the record 12-year major hurricane landfall drought on the U.S. coastline. Since Wilma in October 2005, 31 major hurricanes had swirled in the North Atlantic but all failed to reach the U.S. with a Category 3 or higher intensity.\nEven as we worked to divine exactly where the hurricanes would land, a media narrative began to form linking the devastating storms to climate change. Some found it ironic that states represented by "climate deniers" were being pummeled by hurricanes. Alarmists reveled in the irony that Houston, home to petrochemical plants, was flooded by Harvey, while others gleefully reported that President Trump\'s Mar-a-Lago might be inundated by Irma.\nHow to put these two hurricanes into proper context? An informative website  from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, synthesizes reams of research literature on the links between hurricanes and global warming. Over the next century, climate models generally indicate fewer but stronger storms--between 2% and 11% greater average storm intensity--with substantially increased rain rates. Against the background of slow sea-level rise, explosive coastal population growth will overwhelmingly exacerbate any hurricane\'s damages. In the aggregate, the global-warming signal may just now be emerging out of our noisy observational records, and we may not know certainly for several decades. These conclusions are hardly controversial in the climate-science community.\nMy own research , cited in a recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report , found that during the past half-century tropical storms and hurricanes have not shown an upward trend in frequency or accumulated energy. Instead they remain naturally variable from year-to-year. The global prevalence of the most intense storms (Category 4 and 5) has not shown a significant upward trend either. Historical observations of extreme cyclones in the 1980s, especially in the Southern Hemisphere, are in sore need of reanalysis.\nBy focusing on whether climate change caused a hurricane, journalists fail to appreciate the complexity of extreme weather events. While most details are still hazy with the best climate modeling tools, the bigger issue than global warming is that more people are choosing to live in coastal areas, where hurricanes certainly will be most destructive.\nThe nascent field of "attribution science" attempts to explain how climate change may affect characteristics of a given hurricane using models in "what if" mode. Such research requires a faithful reproduction of events and predictions of the future constrained by subjective choices within computer models. This research also takes time--which means other scientists must examine the evidence with patience and judiciousness not usually seen on Twitter or cable news.\nStill, the scientific community already knows plenty about hurricanes and climate change--knowledge it has accumulated over two decades through peer-reviewed research, academic conferences and voluminous national and international assessments. Yet climate scientists all too often speculate during interviews rather than refer to IPCC reports or their cousins from the U.S. National Climate Assessment. Some climate scientists have peddled tenuous theories with no contemporaneous research evidence. Advocacy groups package these talking points for easy consumption by journalists, who eagerly repeat them.\nThe historical record books contain dozens of devastating hurricane landfalls over the past century, any of which, if repeated, would be catastrophic regardless of additional climate-change effects. To prepare for the next hurricane, the U.S. needs the best weather forecasts, evacuation plans and leadership. These plans should be built on sound science, not speculation, overselling or exaggeration. Hurricane science in this political climate already has enough spin.\nMr. Maue, a research meteorologist, is an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute.\nCredit: By Ryan Maue\n'b'Union environment minister Harsh Vardhan said on Saturday that the country\'s stand on US\'s exit from the Paris Agreement on climate change will be discussed in the next Cabinet meeting after a detailed review.\n"Since the matter is delicate and involves another country , I am not in a position to react on the US president\'s statement. As far as India is concerned, I can promise that we shall comply with the commitment in letter and spirit," Vardhan, who is on a two-day visit for a party meet, told the media here.\nThe statement comes after Tripura CPM advised the Centre to mount pressure on US President Donald Trump over the country\'s departure from the climate change pact.The Paris Agreement, signed  on December 12, 2015 by 195 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, replaced the Kyoto Protocol and aimed at preventing an increase in the average global temperature, keeping it well below 2C.\n"The US has not only been one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the past, but also continues to be one now. Without active and ambitious contribution from the US, any action to combat climate change under the Paris  Agreement will be insufficient by a huge margin," CPM state secretary Bijan Dhar said.\nEven if other nations we re to step up their carbon footprint reduction goals, they would not make up for the dent caused by the US, Dhar said, adding that the US could not shift the burden to countries like India and China.\n"Modiji must recall that to accommodate US interests, Kyoto Protocol had weak targets. However, the Paris Agreement was made a voluntary , bottom-up decentralised regime with no emission reduction commitments for countries and no punitive measures if countries failed to meet their targets. Under its climate action plan, the US had pledged merely 26-28% emission reduction below 2005 levels by 2025. Now, when Trump reneges, how can India maintain silence?" Dhar said.\n'b'While recent developments like the US abandoning the Paris accord have caused a major setback to the fight against the devastating impact of climate change, scientists are warning that time is running out. Communities around the world are experiencing climate change through extreme weather events. The least that can be done is to ensure that businesses, communities and individuals act in whatever way possible. The JSW-The Times of India 8th edition of Earth Care Awards (ECA) is calling on organisations, industries and individuals to apply for ECA awards by August 4, 2017.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC\'s) fifth assessment report had highlighted that India\'s agriculture sector will face the maximum impact of climate change. The report had also suggested that India will face an increase in both mean and extreme rainfall in monsoon, floods and droughts are likely to increase and temperature variations could make disease outbreaks more frequent. In fact, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) recently said, "It is very likely that the number of cold days and nights has decreased and the number of warm days and nights has in creased on the global scale. In large parts of Europe, Asia and Australia, it is likely that the frequency of heat waves has increased." This is why this time, ECA is emphasizing on climate change mitigation and adaptation across sectors.\nThe awards will be in four categories: Community based mitigation and adaptation in water resources, agriculture, forestry and other land use, Innovations for climate protection, GHG Mitigation in large enterprises and Leadership in Urban Climate Action.\nThe Earth Care Awards (ECAs) were launched in 2007-08 and are jointly sponsored by JSW and The Times of India. The ECA aims to address mitigation and adaptation complexities at a larger level, and from 2012, the awards started reaching out to the SAARC region. Centre for Environment Education (CEE) has been the knowledge partner. The process is supported with a well-defined technical and methodological framework for assessment of GHG mitigation and adaptation parameters to define the evaluation process.\nCEE assists the Earth Care Jury in determining the criteria and evaluating the proposals through desk based review and field verification. From 2012, TERRE Policy Centre has also joined the ECA group as an outreach partner. For  the 8th edition of the awards, there is an eminent jury , including RA Mashelkar, president, International Research Alliance; Kartikeya V Sarabhai, founder director, CEE; Rajendra Shende, chairperson, Terre; Aneeta Benninger, executive director, CDSA; Rajat Gupta, director, McKinsey; Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) and Suhas Wani, director, ICRISAT Development Centre.\nThe ECA award includes a citation and a trophy. In the "community" and "innovation" categories, recipients of the awards are also given cash rewards, as decided by the jury. Those interested in applying can get more information at http:www.earthcareawards.com and download the ECA guidebook from the website. ECA is also on twitter @EarthCareAwards.\nLast year the Cochin International Airport and the Panaji City Corporation had won under "Leadership in urban climate action" category , Saguna Rural Foundation had won under "Innovations for climate protection," Nature Environment & Wildlife Society (NEWS) and Bangladesh-based PracticalAction had won under "Community based mitigation and adaptation in water resource, agriculture, forestry and other land use" category.\n'b'Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., issued the following news release:\nRep. Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-08) released the following statement Wednesday regarding the introduction of a resolution by a group of 17 House Republicans calling for using American innovation to improve environmental policy and citing the "conservative principle to protect, conserve, and be good stewards of our environment:"\n"Washington needs independent voices now more than ever - especially when it comes to the environment and public health. The reality is, climate change is real and that humans are a contributing factor. Leaders on both sides of the aisle must take serious and reasonable steps to protect our planet. This resolution - as well as the work of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus - both play a role in setting the table for meaningful discussion surrounding environmental policy in Congress and a starting point for beginning the dialog with the administration regarding climate change. While there is room for debate and discussion on the issue, it is vital that we never politicize protecting our environment or let partisanship prevent Washington from accomplishing common goals."\nFitzpatrick, one of 13 Republican members of the Climate Solutions Caucus, has sought to make environmental protection a bipartisan priority.\nThe ground-breaking resolution calls for better environmental stewardship through "economically viable, and broadly supported private and public solutions to study and address the causes and effects of measured changes to our global and regional climates." The text of the resolution can be found here.\nWhat They\'re Saying:\nMark Reynolds, Executive Director, Citizens\' Climate Lobby\n"The risks of climate change are far too great to get bogged down in partisan politics. With this resolution, these 17 Republicans are saying that business-as-usual is unacceptable when it comes to preserving a livable world for future generations. Hopefully, their leadership will help us turn the page and move forward on solutions to this critical problem."\nDiane Randall, Executive Secretary, Friends Committee on National Legislation (The Quaker lobby in the public interest)\n"The leadership demonstrated by the 17 co-sponsors of this Republican climate resolution is such a hopeful step forward. This resolution shows that our moral obligation to address climate change and protect vulnerable communities transcends partisanship, and that there truly is political will to address this issue from both political parties in Congress. Now, more than ever, we pray that Congress will quickly pivot the dialogue towards meaningful climate solutions."\nDavid Jenkins, President, Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship\n"The significance of this Republican climate resolution cannot be overstated. Real conservatives don\'t deny reality, they face it. They don\'t avoid problems, they tackle them head on. The resolution\'s 17 initial cosponsors are stepping up on an issue that grows more urgent every day, and showing the prudent, fact-based--and yes, conservative--leadership our nation needs. We are grateful for this important first step."\nDan Misleh, Executive Director, Catholic Climate Covenant\n"The Catholic Climate Covenant applauds the moral courage of the 17 Republican legislators who have introduced this resolution. The Catholic Church recognizes the threat that climate change poses to our common home and to human life and dignity - especially of the poor and vulnerable, and of those in future generations. We are heartened that Congress is responding to Pope Francis\'s call in his address to Congress and in Laudato Si to "enter into dialogue with all people about our common home" (Laudato Si\', no. 3). We encourage House members take the next step of joining the bipartisan House Climate Solutions Caucus."\nThe Niskanen Center\n"The sponsors of the Republican Climate Resolution understand that there is nothing conservative about ignoring the enormous risks of climate change. As conservatives, we believe the government exists to protect property rights and lives. It is clear that climate change will put both at risk for our kids and future generations. It is also clear that we have the means to significantly reduce those risks and leave a prosperous and clean future for posterity. The Niskanen Center applauds these Republicans who are looking to take positive steps forward finding practical and market-based solutions for climate change."\nKen Kimmell, President, Union of Concerned Scientists\n"I\'m heartened to see Republican House members introduce a resolution committing Congress to address climate change and base its policy decisions on science and quantifiable facts. While the resolution doesn\'t explicitly make the link to fossil fuel emissions, it shows that these Republican lawmakers are not in a state of denial about this key issue. The U.S. is seeing more extreme weather due to climate change, including flooding, droughts and wildfires, which cost taxpayers billions of dollars in damages. There\'s strength in numbers, and I hope that this sizable group of responsible leaders will have an impact on votes in Congress."\nFrancesco "Frank" Femia and Caitlin Werrell, Co-Founders and Presidents, The Center for Climate and Security\n"This resolution demonstrates that the security risks of climate change are a reality that partisanship cannot continue to obscure. The Department of Defense and intelligence community have recognized this issue across both Republican and Democratic Administrations, and it\'s heartening to see Republican policy-makers from all parts of the country acting on that."\nMindy Lubber, President, Ceres (A nonprofit mobilizing business and investor leadership for a sustainable global economy)\n"Today\'s announcement sends a loud and clear message that addressing climate change need not be a partisan issue. We applaud all lawmakers - no matter their party affiliation - who recognize the urgency of tackling climate change and the enormous economic opportunities of accelerating clean energy in all parts of the United States. The cosponsors of this resolution have shown bold leadership, and we look forward to working with them to craft bipartisan climate solutions that Americans want and expect from Washington."\nLynn Scarlett, Managing Director of Public Policy, The Nature Conservancy\n"As a science-driven organization, The Nature Conservancy strongly supports actions to address climate change. We appreciate the leadership of Reps. Stefanik, Curbelo, and Costello and their fellow members of Congress in recognizing the consequences of a changing climate and calling for solutions to this challenge."\nThe Rev. Mitch Hescox, President/CEO, The Evangelical Environmental Network (EEN)\n"We are proud of the courageous leadership of Rep. Elise Stefanik (NY-21), Rep. Carlos Curbelo (FL-26), Rep. Ryan Costello (PA-6), and the 14 other Republican co-sponsors of this House Resolution affirming that climate change is a serious problem that must be addressed in order for us to be "good stewards of our environment ...".  We heartily concur and stand ready to support efforts to do so".\nHeather Reams, Managing Director, Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions\n"Addressing climate change through clean energy solutions is smart policy and smart politics. Time and again, CRES polling shows that voters overwhelming support lawmakers who prioritize clean energy to advance the economy, create good paying jobs, promote energy independence, and protect the environment."\nAdmiral Frank "Skip" Bowman, U.S. Navy (ret), Member of the Advisory Board, The Center for Climate and Security, Former Director of the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program: "I support this Republican Climate Resolution.  Putting aside arguments of cause and effect, there are measured and measurable data and global events that must be considered and accounted for in our defense planning."\nRear Admiral David W. Titley, U.S. Navy (ret), Member of the Advisory Board, The Center for Climate and Security, Former Oceanographer of the Navy: "I\'m very excited to see the Republican Climate Change Resolution introduced to the Congress.  Our nation\'s long-term security is critically dependent on moving away from fossil-based fuels to lessen the worst risks of climate change.  This change will not happen without support and leadership from the Congress, in partnership with the Administration. The Republican Climate Change Resolution is a good first step towards a serious bi-partisan policy discussion."\nCommander David "Deke" Slayton, U.S. Navy (ret), Member of the Advisory Board, The Center for Climate and Security: "The Republican Climate Resolution ably and well serves as an imperative and call for action for our Nation. The resolution captures the issues of an observable, changing climate and the dynamic events we see unfolding in the worlds oceans today. These critical events demand U.S. Congressional and national executive leadership, now. "\nSherri Goodman, Member of the Advisory Board, The Center for Climate and Security, Former Deputy Undersecretary of Defense: "The Republican Climate Resolution, whose signers represent a broad cross-section of America affected by climate change, from our coasts to rural agricultural areas, soundly recognizes that climate change is a "threat multiplier" that will adversely affect our national security interests as well as all Americans, where we live and work.  The leaders of this effort should be commended for recognizing that we need both to study and address changes in our global and regional climates, and build more resilient communities for America\'s future."\nVice Admiral Lee Gunn, U.S. Navy (ret): "I am enthusiastically adding my support for this Republican Climate Resolution (Ms. Stefanik, et al., \'Expressing the commitment of the House of Representatives to conservative environmental stewardship.\'). The resolution acknowledges, among other things, the enormous national security importance of stewardship of the environment for America. Our armed services depend on predictable conditions at home for training, maintenance, drills and exercises, and bases, all components of building ready military forces. Also, the demands worldwide on not only our military but our economic, diplomatic and political power, demands on all elements of our national power, will inevitably be greater if the environment becomes less predictable. The Republican Climate Resolution supports not only traditional American values, but the practical imperative of maintaining our security at home and abroad."\nColonel Lawrence Wilkerson, U.S. Army (ret), former chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell, Visiting Professor of Government and Public Policy, the College of William and Mary: "The Republican Climate Change Resolution being introduced in the Congress--the Gibson Resolution under new leadership--symbolizes my political party\'s recognition of climate change\'s impact on national security, an impact already being felt from the shipyards at Hampton Roads to the Ship Channel in Houston, Texas.  Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and her 16 Republican co-sponsors are to be congratulated for their herculean efforts to bring my political party to a firm recognition of these risks."\n07M-Furigay-5805902 07M-Furigay\n'b'While recent developments like the US abandoning the Paris accord have caused a major setback to the fight against the devastating impact of climate change, scientists are warning that time is running out. Communities around the world are experiencing climate change through extreme weather events. The least that can be done is to ensure that businesses, communities and individuals act in whatever way possible. The JSW-The Times of India 8th edition of Earth Care Awards (ECA) is calling on organisations, industries and individuals to apply for ECA awards by August 4, 2017.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC\'s) fifth assessment report had highlighted that India\'s agriculture sector will face the maximum impact of climate change. The report had also suggested that India will face an increase in both mean and extreme rainfall in monsoon, floods and droughts are likely to increase and temperature variations could make disease outbreaks more frequent. In fact the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) recently said, "It is very likely that the number of cold days and nights has decreased and the number of warm days and nights has increased on the global scale. In large parts of Europe, Asia and Australia, it is likely that the frequency of heat waves has increased."\nThis is why this time ECA is emphasizing on climate change mitigation and adaptation across sectors.\nThe awards will be in four categories: Community based mitigation and adaptation in water resources, agriculture, forestry and other land use, Innovations for climate protection, GHG Mitigation in large enterprises and Leadership in Urban Climate Action.\nThe Earth Care Awards (ECAs) were launched in 2007-08 and are jointly sponsored by JSW and The Times of India. The ECA aims to ad\ndress mitigation and adaptation complexities at a larger level, and from 2012 the awards started reaching out to the SAARC region. Centre for Environment Education (CEE) has been the knowledge partner. The process is supported with a well-defined technical and methodological framework for assessment of GHG mitigation and adaptation parameters to define the evaluation process.\nCEE assists the Earth Care Jury in determining the criteria and evaluating the proposals through desk based review and field verification. From 2012, TERRE Policy Centre has also joined the ECA group as an outreach partner. For the 8th edition of the awards there is an eminent jury including RA Mashelkar, president, International Research Alliance; Kartikeya V Sarabhai, founder director, CEE; Rajendra Shende, chairperson, Terre; Aneeta Benninger, executive director, CDSA; Rajat Gupta, director, McKinsey; Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) and Suhas Wani, director, ICRISAT Development Centre.\nThe ECA award includes a citation and a trophy . In the "community" and "innovation" categories, recipients of the awards are also given cash rewards, as decided by the jury. Those interested in applying can get more information at http:www.earthcareawards.com and download the ECA guidebook from the website.ECA is also on twitter @EarthCareAwards.\nLast year the Cochin International Airport and the Panaji City Corporation had won under "Leadership in urban climate action" category , Saguna Rural Foundation had won under "Innovations for climate protection," Nature Environment & Wildlife Society (NEWS) and Bangladesh-based PracticalAction had won under "Community based mitigation and adaptation in water resource, agriculture, forestry and other land use" category.\n'b'WHERE have all the cyclones gone -- and are they coming back?\nIf you were one of the millions of Australians who sweltered through the relentless heat of the season dubbed the "angry summer" by climatologists, you would be forgiven for not noticing the tropics have been unusually quiet this year.\nMore than 200 weather records tumbled across Australia this summer, according to the Climate Council, and, just six days into autumn, Cyclone Blanche brought with her yet another, when she became the first of the season to make landfall.\nBlanche crossed the northern coast of Western Australia as a category two storm on March 6, the latest a cyclone has made landfall in Australian history, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.\nIt was just the third tropical low that has formed into a cyclone this season, which began on November 1, well down on the long-term season average of 11.\nIt is the second consecutive year Australia\'s cyclone count has been chronically low.\nLast year, there were just three for the entire season, itself a record for the quietest cyclone count in the country\'s history.\nThat, however, did not particularly surprise scientists at the bureau.\nThey had tipped before the season began that numbers would be low, due to the ongoing effects of an El Nino weather pattern that brings dry air, which is not conducive to the formation of a high-energy cyclone.\nThis year, on the other hand, the low numbers have blindsided them.\nDr Andrew Watkins the manager of climate prediction services at the bureau, said scientists are, at present, trying to get to the bottom of exactly what happened. He said it has also attracted intrigue from international meteor- ologists, with visitors from the United States and the United Kingdom travelling to Australia to try to work out just what is going on.\n"This year, we\'re not in an El Nino, we were heading into a neutral pattern, so we were saying it would be an average to above average season," Dr Watkins said.\n"We would have expected 11 or above and to only have three so far is fascinating.\n"We\'re fascinated by why this season has been so benign."\nThey have a few theories, Dr Watkins said, and are presently crunching the data to get to the bottom of it.\n"There are several theories and at the moment the data is pouring in from satellites and everywhere," he said. "We have here or four ideas and we want to test each one of them out.\n"Many people just think tropical cyclones form over warm water, which is true, but there are other factors, a few things need to come together to form a cyclone.\n"They are quite amazing things that don\'t form that easily. Maybe something strange is happening with one of these factors."\nBut could it be a sign of things to come?\nIn other words, could it be the impact of climate change is already being felt?\nIn the Climate Council\'s Cranking up the Intensity: Climate Change and Extreme Weather Events report released earlier this year, the independent body predicted that in coming years, due to rising temperatures, cyclones would get less frequent but those that formed would be higher in intensity.\nDr Watkins said that did not appear to be the case this year, as the cyclones that had formed had been fairly weak.\nBut he said "basic physics" governed that climate change would increase the intensity of cyclones in the future.\n"For each degree of warming there is about seven per cent more moisture in the atmosphere, so there is more moisture now than, say, 50 years ago," he said.\n"In reasonably simple terms, the warmer it gets, the more steam comes off the water and the warmer the atmosphere, the more moisture it can hold."\nHe said it naturally followed that the amount of rain each cyclone brought would be higher, and thus the cyclone more intense.\nIt does not, however, explain this season\'s anomaly.\n"Being perfectly honest, climate change is a factor in most of our climate science these days but in terms of tropical cyclones you couldn\'t put this season down to climate change," he said.\n"More generally though, the projections are for fewer tropical cyclones but when we do get them, they will potentially be more intense, just not this year."\nWhat it may have caused, however, is the drenching rains that have bucketed down relentlessly on Australia\'s north and west this summer, as the east sweltered.\nBut it seems it\'s not just Australian scientists the always unpredictable Mother Nature is perplexing this season.\n"The whole southern hemisphere is having one of its quietest cyclone seasons on record," Dr Watkins said.\n"But the weather gods have stepped in and we are diagnosing as we speak to try and understand it better."\nCredit: Kim Stephens\n'b'I\'ll admit it: I would have found it fascinating to be party to the discussions earlier this year that led to oscillating headlines on the New York Times home page referring to the new EPA chief Scott Pruitt alternately as a "denier" or "skeptic." At least it would have been fascinating for 20 minutes.\nDitto the hysterical discussions  undoubtedly now arising from an anodyne piece of climate heterodoxy by the paper\'s newest columnist, a former Journal colleague who shall remain nameless, in which he advises, somewhat obscurely, less "certainty" about "data."\nWhether or not this represents progress in how the U.S. media cover the climate debate, a trip down memory lane seems called for.

The 2014 report  of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, voice of climate orthodoxy, is cited for its claim, with 95% confidence, that humans are responsible for at least half the warming between 1951 and 2010.\nLook closely. This is an estimate of the reliability of an estimate. It lacks the most important conjunction in science: "because"--as in "We believe X because of Y."\nNot that the IPCC fails to offer a "because" in footnotes. It turns out this estimate is largely an estimate of how much man-made warming should have taken place if the models used to forecast future warming are broadly correct.\nThe IPCC has a bad reputation among conservatives for some of its press-release activities, but the reports themselves are basically numbing testimonies to how seriously scientists take their work. "If our models are reliable, then X is true" is a perfectly valid scientific statement. Only leaving out the prefix, as the media routinely does, makes it deceptive.\nWe don\'t know what the IPCC\'s next assessment report, due in 2021, will say on this vital point, known as climate sensitivity . But in 2013 it widened the range of uncertainty, and in the direction of less warming. Its current estimate is now identical to that of the 1979 Charney Report . On the key question, then, there has been no progress in 38 years.\nFor journalists, the climate beat has been singularly unrewarding. It has consisted of waiting for an answer that doesn\'t come. By now, thanks to retirements and the mortality tables, the beat\'s originators are mostly gone.

Search its website and the term "climate sensitivity," the central preoccupation of climate science, appears zero times. Any reporter who is truly curious about what scientists know and how they know it would not be working there. Asking such questions would only get him or her suspected of denialism.\nBut not even the EPA\'s Mr. Pruitt or the New York Times\'s newest recruit exhibits the ill grace to phrase the "so what" question.\n"So what" is the most important question of all. So what if human activity is causing some measure of climate change if voters and politicians are unwilling to assume the costs (possibly hugely disproportionate to any benefit) of altering the outcome of the normal evolution of energy markets and energy technology.\nEven liberals have noticed that climate advocacy has morphed into a religion, unwilling to deal honestly with uncertainty or questions of cost and benefit. Climate apoplexy, like many single-issue obsessions, is now a form of entertainment for exercised minorities, allowing them to vent personal qualities that in most contexts they would be required to suppress.\nWhether apocryphal or even a joke, who did not delight in the story of "Zach ," the young Democratic staffer who supposedly stormed out of a postelection meeting after cursing the party\'s incompetent elders because, thanks to Hillary Clinton\'s defeat, "I\'m going to die from climate change."\nFor the record, Zach, an estimate  recently touted by the Washington Post  precisely because it was five or 10 times worse than previous estimates had this to say about the consequences of climate change.

Only senior scientist Dipanjana Moulin represented the environment department at the summit. "States must demand greater participation in determining India\'s climate response at the national and global levels. For Bengal, this is an investment opportunity as well," Roy said.\nShe added: "City and statelevel action has to streamline with the national goals." Kolkata and south Bengal are among the most vulnerable regions of the world to climate change, with sea-level rise estimated to cause huge inundation and displacement. Climate change mitigation will affect eastern states the most as they are rich in coal. According to Roy, Bengal must start a dialogue on investment to clean up the coal sector with the zest it had exibited in the run-up to the GST rollout.\n"A senior official needs to take a leadership position on how the National Clean Energy Fund accrued from coal cess is disbursed among coal-rich states in the east, including Bengal, to invest in clean coal technology," said Roy. As the world talks about deep decarbonisation, India has no alternative but to become carbon-neutral. Bengal and other coal-rich states will require funds to be spent on environment cleanup, coal substitute, carbon capture and storage technology.\n16 of 17 hottest years since 2000\nThe five warmest years in terms of average global temperature have all occurred since 2010, and 16 of the 17 hottest years on record have come since 2000. This year is on track to be the second warmest year after last year\'s peak. TNN\n'b'This is part two of a three-part series on climate change. Part one appeared in Tuesday\'s News and part three will appear in Thursday\'s News. \nI agree with the Wildrose Party that the NDP\'s carbon tax is a bad idea though perhaps for different reasons. It\'s not that I don\'t believe in climate change N I do, it\'s just that this fight over carbon emissions and green energy misses the real problem. \nLet\'s say we woke up tomorrow and magically the world had converted to 100 per cent renewable energy. Only wind farms, solar farms, tidal power stations, and electric cars. Would this miraculous transformation save the planet? \nThis would stop carbon from increasing in the atmosphere. That\'s great except that climate change is only one environmental problem facing humanity. You don\'t believe in climate change? OK, let\'s forget about this one and talk about our other upcoming challenges. \nEarth system scientists are trying to understand what it would mean for humanity to live in balance with our planet. To be sure humans are at the early stages of understanding our complicated biosphere, but they have come up with nine planetary boundaries essential for human life. \n1. Biosphere integrity; over the past 50 years humans have increasingly changed a multitude of ecosystems leading to increasing biodiversity loss. \n2. Stratospheric ozone depletion. Remember when we were worried about the ozone hole over Antarctica? The stratospheric ozone layer protects the planet from lethal UV radiation. The \'Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer\' was signed in 1987. This international agreement saved the ozone layer, which is now recovering. \n3. Chemical pollution and the release of novel entities. New chemical compounds are being released into ecosystems. The effects may be sub-lethal, but can cause decreased fertility in organisms and continue to accumulate. \n4. Climate change. We\'re skipping this one. \n5. Ocean acidification. Tied to the increasing carbon in the atmosphere. Increasing acidity makes it harder and harder for marine organisms to build their "bones." \n6. Freshwater consumption. It\'s going up and we\'re increasingly altering freshwater systems. \n7. Land system change. We\'re converting a lot of natural land for human use, mainly farmland. \n8. Nitrogen and phosphorus runoff pollution of waterways. Causes algae blooms that create oxygen-starved waters. \n9. Atmospheric aerosol loading. I couldn\'t understand this one never mind trying to explain it to you. \nEach of the nine have safe zones. Biodiversity integrity along with nitrogen and phosphorus runoff pollution are at dangerous levels right now. We\'re OK with the others for now, but most are increasing. Even minus climate change, there are clear signs that humanity\'s current environmental trend is dangerous. \nCarbon taxes are meant to steer humanity to a carbon neutral lifestyle. But we shouldn\'t equate a carbon neutral life with a sustainable one. The proponents of green energy don\'t seem to appreciate the consequences of this switch. Let\'s think about what moving off of fossil fuels would take. Every internal combustion engine would have to be replaced. That\'s every bulldozer, cargo-ship, car, truck, weed-whacker, lawn mower, generator, power plant and chainsaw. Building "green" machines require huge amounts of resources. That would lead to greater environmental problems. Conservatives are right to be suspicious about green energy. \nHowever, on this issue both climate change believers and deniers are thinking too narrowly. Think of your parents\' lifestyle and compare it with your own. Think of your grandparents\' lifestyle. We consume more and more. Climate change is not the problem. It\'s a symptom, like the other increasing planetary boundaries. The root problem is overconsumptionNthat\'s the underlying issue. Switching to green energy while keeping consumption at current levels just trades one environmental problem for others. Thus a carbon tax will ultimately be an ineffective solution to our environmental problems. \nOur lifestyles are at issue and, simply put, technology will not save us. So what should we do about it? Nothing. \nWhile Premier Rachel Notley and the NDP\'s intentions are noble they are wrong to impose this controversial carbon tax without a clear mandate from Albertans. A carbon tax wasn\'t part of their platform and let\'s not forget a clear majority of Albertans voted for conservative parties. The NDP majority in the Alberta legislature does not accurately reflect the electorate. It is based on a quirk and weakness of our first-past-the-post electoral system. Should conservatives win the next election it\'s hard to imagine the carbon tax will stand. Progress can\'t be made by lurching between the two sides. \nIt\'s easy to argue against climate change and the clumsy efforts to curb it. It\'s harder to ignore the larger environmental picture. But before we can agree on a solution, we must first agree that there is a problem. So let\'s first do the hard work of building consensus and persuading each other. It\'s better to wait a decade then move towards solutions united then to try and address these issues divided. \n@KrisSamraj is a writer.

But this is the first world threatening climate catastrophe humans can truly call our own. We are fouling our own nest, stealing from our grandchildren and their future.\nClimate change is occurring rapidly in terms of geological time, but too slowly to attract our full attention. Earths life supporting climate system faces threat from the fossil fuel-dependent material needs of a rapidly increasing population. Those alluring moon bases promised as alternative accommodation by the golden age of science fiction disappointingly failed to materialize. Might science fiction authors fantasies of terraforming Mars become a matter of necessity before too long?\nClimate fiction (Cli Fi) is the literature of our planet in transformation. Focusing specifically on human-created climate change, it allows readers to imagine and experience its complexity. Extrapolated from scientific data rather than pure imagination, climate fiction draws attention to the physical, political, and socio-economic changes that will no doubt be required to mitigate and adapt to the ever-increasing threat of global warming, such as reorientation of economies, government intervention, and changes to mass consumption practices.\nClimate science speaks of great uncertainties: targets outlined in the Paris Agreement are no longer achievable, the release of methane from the melting permafrost might be more devastating than previously guessed. Bleaching coral, ravaged crops, and the spread of vector-borne diseases are only the tip of the iceberg.\nClimate fiction is shaping up as the literature of now because were past the point of no return regarding science fictions cautionary tales. Many of science fictions blockbuster books and films warned us with catastrophic visions of the future. But caution was not exercised; it was thrown recklessly to the winds, and remains there still.\nClimate fiction utilizes similar literary plot devices as traditional disaster narratives: historical monuments destroyed, familiar skylines ablaze or drowned and families torn apart. But cli fi narratives enhance and emphasize realism by presenting global warming and associated effects as an immediate and verified problem, rather than something that may happen in another place or time, or by accident or the wrath of god. Many cli fi novels feature scientists, either strategically placed to deliver information, investigate or provide explanations for environmental events, or as protagonists effecting change to traditional institutions or ways of thinking.\nMost effective are the stories revealing what life might feel like when affected by events such as carbon rationing, mass transience, the spread of vector-borne diseases, extreme heat and water shortages-and everything played out through characters and their actions, as all good fiction should. The plots also often mirror current events: reflecting widening chasms between rich and poor; countries overtaken by militant authoritarianism, ushering in a return to brutal religious fundamentalism; barren lands lashed by killer storms; flooded cities; drought-stricken farmlands; post-catastrophe cityscapes tainted by a breakdown of law and order and stateless populations on the move. Some of these situations might sound more familiar than others.\nCli fi is in the process of expanding its parameters and becoming a contemporary literature of purpose and revolution. It is challenging the status quo of business as usual, of capitalism as a perpetual motion machine eternally borrowing from the future, passing the burden of recovery up the line by using real science, real data and real scenarios to envision our near future. We best pay heed to what climate fiction is illuminating: it is fast becoming the literature of transition, of loss, of learning and adjustment to wilder times and, ultimately, a literature of hope as we face the prospect of adjusting to a warmer, wilder world.\nCat Sparks is author of the novel Lotus Blue, available from Talos Press, an imprint of Skyhorse.\n'b'Jennifer White, a graduate student at Lakehead University, is hoping her research into domestic violence will not only impact the lives of people in Thunder Bay but also across Canada. \nWorking on her masters degree in social work, White is one of the recipients of grant money from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada that is funding researchers at Lakehead University with nearly $900,000. \nThrough her research White, with the help of $17,500 in funding, will be interviewing men who have been identified as perpetrators of violence towards their intimate partners in the hopes of better understanding their experiences towards preventing others from taking the same path. \n"There\'s lots of gaps in how it\'s understood," said White. "I just want to better the understanding to help programs with how they fund or how they view these issues." \nAnd Lindsay Galway, assistant professor in the department of Health Sciences, received $54,478 to fund a two-year project that examines how to engage the public in climate change discussions. \n"How do we talk about the issues, how do we frame it so it connects to what people in this place care about?" said Galway, whose research will focus on what climate change means to people in two northern Canadian communities, Thunder Bay and Prince George, British Columbia. \n"We\'ll be doing interviews with folks across the region, Northern Ontario and Northern B.C. to understand what\'s working and what\'s not (in conversations about climate change)," said Galway. \nGalway called having government support for scientific research "ultimately important." \n"How do we make decisions if we don\'t have support for our science and our research and we don\'t have the funding that\'s needed to develop the evidence?" said Galway. "It is a foundation of our society, we can\'t have a prosperous, healthy society that can progress in great directions in the context of climate change if we\'re not respecting and listening to science." \nIt is research, explained Patty Hajdu, minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour, that helps the government make decisions about policy making and what programs to fund. \n"As a government that profoundly believes in evidence-based decision making it\'s really hard to do that if you don\'t have the research and you don\'t understand whether a policy initiative is the right decision to take for Canadians or will actually not result in the kind of change that you\'re hoping," said Hajdu (L-Thunder Bay-Superior North). \nVisiting Lakehead University on Friday on behalf of Kirsty Duncan, minister of Science, to meet some of the researchers who are benefiting from the government grants, Hajdu said she was "blown away by the diversity of the different research." \n"Those are the kinds of things that can make my job as a politician and other politicians\' jobs much easier because we actually have a body of evidence to draw on," said Hajdu. "We often think we have solutions and sometimes we find out those solutions just aren\'t as effective as we had hoped, so all the research in all of these areas helps people make good decisions with often very limited funding." \nWhite said meeting Hajdu was "incredibly impactful" as it confirmed that her research is of interest and potentially change making. \n"(The funding) is immensely helpful," said White. "There\'s lots of costs I didn\'t anticipate with doing front-line qualitative research. It just helps with the whole process making it that much more possible and accessible to people in the end."\nCredit: By Heather Peden  The Chronicle-Journal\n'b'#KATHMANDU Global warming is not only posing serious threat to glaciers, it will also result in a loss of 33 per cent of total ice volume in the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region by the end of the century, leading dire consequences for locals.\n"Climate is warming up. If it rises by 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of 21st century, we will see a loss of onethird of total ice volume in HKH region. This will be of glaciers, snow and ice," Dr Philippus Wester, scientist at the Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), said on Monday.\n"It is one of the key findings of the Hindu Kush Himalayan Monitoring and Assessment Programme (HIMAP)," he added.\nAddressing the "International Conference on Resilient Hindu Kush Himalaya: Developing Solutions towards a Sustainable Future for Asia", Wester said several studies have suggested that global climate warming should be kept to 1.5 degrees Celsius until the end of the century. But even this would be too hot for the HKH region, because it would mean 2.1 degrees Celsius rise in temperature there.\nMore than 400 experts including scientists, environmentalists and policymakers from 26 countries are taking part in the meet that began on Sunday. Over the next two days, the participants will discuss ideas for strengthening the fragile environment and solutions for mountain communities of the Hindu Kush Himalayas, which extends from Afghanistan to Myanmar.\nWester said the full report of the Hindu Kush Himalayan Monitoring and Assessment Programme (HIMAP) would be launched in mid-2018.\n"HIMAP is an unique initiative, first of its kind for HKH region on the line of AMAP(Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme). It is a part of the HKH science policy dialogue to help policy makers from the region."\nAccording to him, the report is like a mini-IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report specific to HKH region. "It is a long term integrated science policy initiative that aims to support policy change and sustainable solutions for problems in the mountains. It will make a difference as it is a landmark report."\nA comprehensive assessment of the HKH region will assess the current state of knowledge of the HKH region, address critical data gaps and increase the understanding of various drivers of change and their impacts.\nBased on the assessment, HIMAP will recommend a set of practicallyoriented policy recommendations. The assessment process will involve a broad and diverse group of researchers, practitioners and policy makers, and culminate in a major publication with a highly-reputed international publishing house in 2017.\nA. Kulkarni, scientist at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, said it was a result of global warming that in most of the HKH region, glaciers were thinning, retreating and losing mass volume.\n"It is a trend that is projected to continue with possibly large changes in the timing and magnitude of glacier melt runoff."\nKulkarni, who is attending the conference as part of a team of scientists behind HIMAP said: "In future, the volume of seasonal snow is going to decrease and the peak of stream discharge will come early and many springs will become dry."\n'b'Global leadership is urgently needed to ensure greenhouse gas emissions peak within 10 years, or the future costs of reining them in and adapting to a changing climate will rise dramatically, the head of the United Nations\' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said on Monday.\nThe IPCC\'s Hoesung Lee spoke at an Ottawa session on Canada\'s climate challenge, where he dodged questions about the Trump administration\'s opposition to concerted global action on climate change, saying it is not his role to comment on policies of member states.\nBased on the panel\'s scientific work, Dr. Lee said global temperatures are rising at a unprecedented pace and that concerted action is required to avert the worst impacts of rising sea levels, threats to species and extreme weather events.\n"The important matter is the speed of change," the soft-spoken South Korean economist said in an interview after his speech.\n"We know now that the global warming is unprecedented and at the same time, it may be happening much faster than the capacity to adapt. Which means that sooner or later, the concern about cascading risks and the irreversibility in certain ecosystems becomes a real concern."\nU.S. President Donald Trump has questioned the science of climate change, famously tweeting at one point that it was a "hoax" perpetrated by the Chinese. The new administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, recently questioned whether carbon-dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel use is contributing to climate change, as IPCC reports have concluded.\nEarlier this week, Mr. Trump\'s Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, attended a Group of Seven ministerial meeting and blocked a proposed statement in which ministers would have reaffirmed their governments\' commitment to the Paris accord, which was adopted by 195 countries in December, 2015.\nThe IPCC and other international bodies have said greenhouse gas emissions need to peak before 2030 - some say by 2020 - to give the world a reasonable chance of limiting average global temperature increases to less than 2 C, as countries pledged in the Paris agreement.\n"If we miss that early peaking, the implication is that it will be much costlier to achieve that two-degree goal," Dr. Lee said.\n"It means temperatures will rise by more than two degrees with consequences attending that increase in temperatures.\nThe probability of extreme weather events occurring would increase, and that should be a concern for policy makers and investors around the world."\nCarbon pricing is a "very critical" tool for driving the transition to a lower-carbon economy, though other measures are required, he said. About 25 countries around the world are now adopting some form of carbon pricing, and there are related benefits - including cleaner air and healthier populations - that help offset the costs, he added.\nThe federal government is planning to introduce legislation later this year that will require provinces to adopt some form of carbon pricing, or have imposed a federal levy with the revenues returned to the provincial government.\nCritics worry the Liberal government\'s determination to proceed with climate-change policies will hurt the Canadian economy, given the Trump administration is headed in the opposite direction.\nIn a report released on Monday, the Conference Board of Canada said the economic cost to Canada of achieving its 2030 target would be manageable, though clearly provinces such as Alberta and Saskatchewan face steeper costs than others.\n"A lot of Canadian businesses are worried about what are the economic consequences of carbon pricing," said Craig Alexander, chief economist at the Conference Board, a non-profit research company. "What is it going to do to our competitiveness?" He said the overall impact on economic growth and jobs would be negligible, though energy-intensive industries such as chemicals, forest products, and oil and gas would feel a bigger bite.\nHowever, Mr. Alexander said his forecast could not take into account technological change that would occur as a result of putting a price on carbon. He added that there are also longerterm costs to a "business-asusual" approach that must be considered.\nCredit: Staff\n'b'The Holocene epoch in which we now live is widely regarded for its climatic stability. In truth, heating and cooling spells over the past 11,700 years characterize this interglacial period. The Altithermal of some 9,000 to 6,000 years ago brought drought to the American West. Far more recently, the Little Ice Age decreased temperatures and triggered glaciation. Holocene climate changes are the result of natural forcings, including changes in the earths orbital geometry, sunspots and volcanic eruptions. Human societies around the world adapted, degenerated or collapsed in response to Holocene climate changes.\nIn contrast, humankinds reliance on fossil fuels is the principle cause of global warming today, not natural forcings. The science is overwhelming. Still, astrophysicist Neil Degrasse Tyson noted that, while Americans accept the science behind the solar eclipse and Hurricane Harvey predictions, many still deride the evidence for human-caused climate change.\nSurely, Montanas blistering temperatures and massive wildfires are canaries in the coal mine. We urgently must: stop politicizing this issue; trust the hard science; reject the self-serving prattlings of politicians and CEOs; and combat the heating of our precious and only planet for the sake of our children and future generations. We own this.

Parisi said the county will continue to try to reduce carbon emissions, increase the use of solar and renewable energy and prepare for the impact of a changing climate.\n"We can show other units of government and leaders in the private sector that we can make a positive impact on the government and at the same time saving dollars and improving the environment," he said.\nA recently created Office of Energy and Climate Change will work with a county climate council to identify ways for the county to meet, or exceed, goals of the Paris climate agreement, he said.\nThe announcement comes after Trump said this month that he would pull the U.S. out of the agreement that sought to limit the impact of climate change and minimize global temperature increases.\nTrump said the deal was unfair to the U.S. and would result in lost jobs, lower wages and closed factories.\nBut as of May more than 1,200 U.S. cities, counties, states, universities and businesses like Apple and Nike in the "We Are Still In" coalition have vowed to adhere to the provisions of the climate pact, saying that sticking to the terms of the agreement would create jobs and promote trade while reducing carbon emissions.\nThe agreement has been signed by 149 countries.\nElsewhere in Wisconsin, UW-Stevens Point and the cities of Milwaukee and Glendale have agreed to meet the goals of the Paris climate accord.\nThe Dane County Board will review a resolution affirming its support of the county\'s move in the coming weeks.\nDane County will send a letter to the Wisconsin Counties Association this week to encourage other counties in the state to join the coalition or agree to meet goals of the Paris agreement.\nWith the state and federal government "putting their heads in the sand with climate change, it\'s up to us at the local level to fight climate change and lead by example," Parisi said.\nCredit: CHRIS AADLAND caadland@madison.com\n'b'The Canadian Press \nOTTAWA \nClimate change talks in Germany are headed for a collision course on coal this week N and Canada is right in the middle of it. \nEnvironment Minister Catherine McKenna is arriving today in Bonn, Germany, to attend the second week of COP23, the annual United Nations climate change talks that two years ago led to the Paris climate change accord. \nThis year, the parties to Paris are hammering out rules for how that accord will be implemented, how carbon will be counted and how countries will be held accountable for their emissions cuts. \nMcKenna and her British counterpart, Claire Perry, minister of state for climate change and industry, want the conversation to focus on getting rid of coal as a power source, which is responsible for more than 40 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions. \nMcKenna and Perry are hosting a joint event Nov. 16 to launch a joint campaign calling for other countries to declare a plan not to build any more unabated coal-fired plants and eliminate existing ones. Unabated plants are those that have no carbon capture or storage technology to keep emissions from ending up in the atmosphere. \n"We want every country to look at how they can reduce their use of coal and phase it out and we want to be supporting developing countries to do so," McKenna told The Canadian Press in an interview last week. \nMcKenna did not, however, commit any additional money to the program. \nAbout 10 per cent of electricity in Canada comes from coal, and 40 per cent of the electricity around the world is generated by coal-fired power plants. \nA year ago, Canada committed to eliminating coal as a source of power by 2030. Britain has committed to getting rid of it by 2025. \nSince Canada and the U.K. first announced their coal phase-out campaign last month, Italy and Netherlands added themselves to the list of countries aiming to get rid of coal. France had already set a 2025 coal-phase out target. \nBut their anti-coal initiative is in direct contrast with the United States, which is kicking off the week with an event promoting all the ways fossil fuels like coal can be part of the narrative of combating climate change. \n"I anticipate it will be a big story this week," said Catherine Abreu, executive director of Climate Action Network Canada, who has been in Bonn since the talks began Nov. 6. \nLast month, Scott Pruitt, the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, declared the "war on coal is over" as he tore up the U.S. Clean Power Plan, a legacy of President Barack Obama that required states to cut emissions based on energy consumption and offered incentives to foster renewable power and energy efficiency. \nThe U.S. successfully managed to convince the G20 to include a statement about the U.S. helping other countries "access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently" in its final statement in July. On Monday, U.S. officials and fossil fuel industry representatives will make presentations about it. \nMcKenna however said the world has already decided with its money that coal is a relic of the past. \n"The market has moved on coal so the good news is you now have clean energy like wind and solar that\'s cheaper and there\'s far more investments in wind and solar than there is in coal," she said. \nDespite her bravado, the Global Coal Plant Tracker shows plans are afoot for another 1,600 new coal plants, which once operational would expand coal power by 42 per cent around the world. \nChina\'s energy companies are behind 700 of them, despite China\'s pledge earlier this year to scale back its coal plans at home. India\'s state-run National Thermal Power Corp. intends to invest more than $10 billion to build new coal plants over the next five years. \nIf Canada and the U.K. can get China and India involved to some extent, it would be a real victory, Abreu said. She doesn\'t expect them to agree to phase coal out entirely, but agreeing to help would be a big step. \nGermany would be another big get for the coalition, and may be an easier fish to land if German Chancellor Angela Merkel tries to get the German Green Party into her coalition. The Greens want Germany to meet its emissions reduction targets, which would require it to abandon coal. \nN Follow @mrabson on Twitter\nCredit: Sender_2\n'b'This week Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency acknowledged  that humans do indeed contribute to a warming climate.\nMr. Pruitt\'s concession to scientific consensus came with a caveat: "The real issue is how much we contribute to it and measuring that with precision." Indeed, how regulators measure climate impact matters more than agreeing that such an impact exists. This makes President Donald Trump\'s order last week  scrapping official estimates of the "\nsocial cost of carbon " especially significant. Without actually disputing the science behind climate change, it drastically raises the bar  to acting on it.\nFederal rules are supposed to cost the economy and society less than the harm they prevent. But regulators long lacked any benchmark for the costs of greenhouse gas emissions. Courts have ruled they can\'t assume the costs are zero, so in 2010 Barack Obama\'s administration, after lengthy study, began estimating the social cost of carbon. It put the future damage, such as from rising sea levels, crop damage and heat-related death, of emitting one metric ton of carbon dioxide in 2015 at $42.\nCritics argued the Obama administration chose assumptions that inflated that figure. Mr. Trump responded by instructing agencies to use broad regulatory guidance issued in 2003 that allows much less stringent assumptions. Yet most of the criticism of the initial estimates doesn\'t stand up. Indeed, equally plausible assumptions would justify a higher figure.\nThe most widespread criticism of Mr. Obama\'s social cost of carbon is that it was derived from complex models that link emissions to atmospheric concentrations to temperature and then to economic damage.\nThis, they say, yields results that are so uncertain they can\'t justify costly and irreversible mitigation measures. Critics also note that actual temperatures seem less responsive to CO2 than models predicted, which the United Nations-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change acknowledged in 2014.\nBut the answer to imperfect models isn\'t to ignore them but to improve them. Michael Greenstone, a University of Chicago economist who led the Obama administration\'s effort, says about 150 reputable studies of climate damage have been released since 2009 and they would appear to justify an even higher social cost of carbon: "The evidence so far is that the damages are greater than we understood" for example due to heat-related deaths in India .\nAnd uncertainty alone doesn\'t justify inaction. Military and terrorist attacks are also highly uncertain, yet the U.S. spends more than 3% of national income to prevent them on the theory that spending nothing makes an attack more likely. Moreover, their consequences are asymmetric: peace in the best case scenario, nuclear annihilation in the worst.\nThe consequences of global warming are similarly uncertain and asymmetric. One can posit zero or even positive effects, such as fewer deaths from cold in the best case. One can also posit massive and arbitrary destruction from rising sea levels, storms and biological die-off in the worst.\nRobert Pindyck, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, argues  climate policy should be geared to preventing extreme scenarios rather than the unreliable base-case projections of models. According to his survey of experts, to eliminate even a small risk of a 20% loss of future global income would require a social cost of carbon equal to $80 to $100 per ton.\nAnother controversy is over the rate at which the benefit of preventing future harm is discounted. As in all of finance, the lower the discount rate, the greater the value in today\'s dollars. Federal guidance in 2003 required regulators to discount benefits at both 3% (the real, or after-inflation return, on government bonds) and 7% (the return on private investments). The Obama administration used only 3%. Critics note 7% would have produced a far lower figure. Yet with time, the lower discount rate looks ever more sensible. In 2003 government bonds yielded 2% after inflation; today, just 0.5%.\nThe most valid criticism of the social cost of carbon is that the Obama administration calculated the harm U.S. emissions cause to the entire world, departing from the convention of considering only harm to U.S. residents, which would slash the $42 cost per ton of CO2 to as little as $3.\nThere was a logic to this. The harm that carbon dioxide causes to any country, unlike acid rain or mercury, is the same no matter where on earth it originates.\nYet holding the U.S. to a global benchmark could cause high carbon industries to move to countries that don\'t adopt the same standard, leaving emissions unchanged and Americans worse off.\nThat doesn\'t sit well with Mr. Trump\'s "America first" worldview. Mr. Greenstone responds that had the U.S. ignored the implications for the world in its own climate rules, it wouldn\'t have extracted emissions commitments from China in 2014 and the rest of the world in 2015.\nIf the global cost of carbon is mostly a tool for inducing other countries to cooperate, Mr. Trump could turn this to his advantage. Chinese President Xi Jinping will likely press him this week to abide by the 2015 emissions limits. Mr. Trump could respond that if China subjects all its decisions to the social cost of carbon, the U.S. will do the same.\nFirst, though, Mr. Trump has to decide he cares.\nWrite to Greg Ip at  greg.ip@wsj.com\nCredit: By Greg Ip\n'b'State governors and city mayors were quick to claim the mantle of U.S. leadership in fighting climate change after President Donald Trump said Thursday that the country would pull out of the Paris climate agreement.\nThe officials said they collectively could show the world that the United States remained committed to cutting the emissions that scientists blame for global warming. Governors and analysts cited moves including California\'s effort to get 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources, northeast states potentially tightening maximum allowances for carbon and Oregon working on measures to put a price on carbon.\n"There is a pathway here where the rest of America in reaction to, really, what is an insane decision by President Trump, takes the kind of steps needed," California Gov. Jerry Brown said.\nCalifornia, along with the German state of Baden-Wurttemberg, helped organize in 2015 the Under2 Coalition, made up of state and local governments worldwide that have committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent to 95 percent by 2050. By contrast, the United States committed to reduce emissions only up to 28 percent by 2025 under the Paris agreement.\nMore than 170 governments on six continents have since joined the coalition, including the states of Washington, Oregon, Vermont, Rhode Island, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota and New Hampshire. Altogether, the coalition claims to represent more than 1.18 billion people and $27.5 trillion in gross domestic product, or 37 percent of the world\'s economy.\nSome 61 U.S. mayors have vowed to uphold the commitments of the global agreement.\nSt. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson\'s administration intends to "continue our efforts to reduce our carbon footprint in accordance with the Paris agreement," spokesman Koran Addo wrote in a statement.\nKrewson tweeted Thursday afternoon: "Standing with my fellow #ClimateMayors to protect our future. #StLouis will do its part to honor the #ParisAgreement. @ClimateMayors"\nOn Capitol Hill, Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Miami, said a group of congressional Republicans and Democrats, largely from coastal states, would redouble its efforts to find ways to reduce the risks of climate change.\nMayors from major cities around the world also said they remained committed to the Paris climate accord.\nThe mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, says climate change "poses a unique threat to the future of our planet, and puts in peril the health, prosperity, security and the very survival of our children and grandchildren."\nCredit: From news services; The Tribune Bureau and Reuters contributed to this report.\nCaption: FILE - In this Friday Sept. 22, 2006 file photo an oil refinery is seen at sunset in Rodeo, Calif.

I have deep concerns about Rex Tillerson as secretary of state.\nMontanans know climate change is real. A recent bipartisan poll showed a majority of us are very concerned about climate change. Montanans value independent thinking and are not fooled by Tillersons business pedigree.\nSixteen of the hottest years on record have happened since 2000, and up to 8 feet of sea level rise is virtually guaranteed by 2100. Exxon led a campaign of denial about the impacts of the fossil fuel industry on our climate, turning climate change into a political football and making our task of addressing it today much more difficult.\nI work with Climate Smart Missoula, an organization that seeks to reduce our carbon footprint and prepare our community to deal with climate impacts. Here in Montana, we're seeing earlier snowmelt, and more of our precipitation falling as rain. These trends contribute to more large wildfires and the choking smoke that comes along with them, disproportionately impacting the poor, elderly and children.\nI am also a Christian. I work with Faith and Climate Action Montana, a group of clergy and people of faith across the state who believe we are called to protect our planet for generations to come. Tillerson is morally unqualified to represent our nation when the climate stakes are so high. We need leaders with vision to see clearly our responsibility to solve climate change, not leaders whose vision is clouded by 40 years in polluting industries and putting profits over people.\nTillerson may be an adept negotiator, but he cannot be trusted to serve Montanans and regular people. You voted for him; the people of Montana deserve to know why.\n\nAbby Huseth,\n\n\nMissoula\n\n"b'The Trump White House may have met its match attempting to disparage as fake news the latest leak: a near-final draft of the National Climate Assessment.\nThe science agencies of the federal government are obligated by law to produce the National Climate Assessment (NCA) every four years, so-unlike many other less institutionalized efforts-this work on climate change marches on. In a sensationalized story, the fifth draft of the fourth NCA, due for publication in 2018, was reportedly leaked to the New York Times on Monday. (Subsequent coverage suggests the draft report couldnt have been leaked because versions of it were already publicly available.)\nThe report, which focuses on climate impacts within the United States, would be shocking if its findings werent consistent with the distressing findings the scientific community has been producing for decades-with ever-increasing certainty and specificity-on observed climatic changes and future projections. The report finds that temperatures nationwide have risen 1.2F to 1.8F since early in the twentieth century and that human activity is almost surely responsible for almost all of it. Maximum daily precipitation-the intensity of rainstorms, a contributor to floods and sewage treatment system overloads-has increased on average 10 to 20 percent, including 20 to 29 percent in the Northeast. Since the late 1990s, high temperature (heat) records outnumber low temperature (cold) records by more than 3 to 1. The global average sea level is accelerating and is likely to constitute 1 to 4 feet by the year 2100, which will have devastating impacts on low-lying coastal areas. Coastal inundation is already widely observed throughout the U.S. All of this is asserted with high to very high confidence. Perhaps most alarming, there is a significant possibility of critical threshold or tipping point events [of climate impacts] some of which may be abrupt and/or irreversible.\nThe NCA is one of the most rigorously sourced and vetted documents produced by the federal government. For those keeping score at home, it weighs in at 673 pages and its sources include peer reviewed journal articles, technical reports by Federal agencies, scientific assessments reports of the National Academy of the Sciences and various regional climate impact assessments. Fake news it is not.\nAnd yet, senior Trump officials review and approve the final report. In the atmosphere of science suppression pervading the Trump administration, many fear the worst: political appointees might adulterate the findings, which scientists who worked on the report reasonably fear. Lets recall who these senior Trump officials are. The president appointed climate deniers and skeptics Scott Pruitt, Ryan Zinke and Rick Perry to run the Environmental Protection Administration, Department of Interior and Department of Energy, respectively, and their ranks of political appointees have been stuffed with fossil fuel lobbyists and free market ideologues. Trump and his team have rolled back regulations designed to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions and have promoted coal mining on federal lands.\nThus far, the results have been ugly. Perhaps most alarming and Orwellian has been an effort to expunge climate science from the federal government. It starts at the top: Trump, bucking tradition, does not have a White House science advisor to translate hard science into laymans terms and solve policy challenges using science. The EPA has eviscerated its science advisory board, bullied its senior scientists into changing their congressional testimony, and deleted almost all mention of climate change from its website, even scrubbing it from its small in-house museum. Trumps proposed budget slashes funding for basic science that studies climate change as well as research and development for environmentally friendly technologies. Efforts by the White House transition team to root out information on those working on climate change at the Department of Energy struck one senior official as redolent of McCarthyism. The Interior and Agriculture Departments have censored talk of climate change and canceled meetings in order to muzzle climate experts. And State Department climate diplomats are obligated to declare their support for clean and efficient fossil fuels.\nSo what will Trump do with NCA4?\nIf the Trump ethos of posturing over substance holds, not much. While the public brouhaha surrounding the (non-)leaked report may have made alteration by Trump loyalists politically inadvisable, the White House will ignore or malign the NCA. After all, if the truth doesnt conveniently align with political advantage, the Trump administration routinely and reliably resorts to alternative facts and discredits the sources of offending information.\nWhy, if the truth about the climate is so abundantly clear, doesnt the president simply embrace it? First, climate change does not (at least, according to Trump) make for good reality TV. Al Gore makes movies about it, for goodness sake; viewership of season one of the blockbuster series Years of Living Dangerously was miniscule. Second, taking action on climate change is even harder politically than health care: Theres a reason in 2009 President Barack Obama tackled the Affordable Care Act first-which passed-and the Waxman-Markey cap and trade bill second in 2010, which died in the Senate without a vote. (Obama hardly made a peep about climate change again until after his reelection in 2012.) Furthermore, climate change is not an easy issue to look tough on, like strutting around with generals and coal miners, or to recruit conservatives to support-thanks to decades of disinformation, brainwashing, and arm-twisting of Republicans by the fossil fuel industry. And lastly, of course, coming up with solutions requires patience and governance, not petulance and tweets; serious policymaking, not blind repeal and replace; and listening to the science, not conspiracy theories. Politicians, the saying goes, campaign in poetry but govern in prose. Not Trump. In his world, there is no governance; its theater, personal interest, and loyalty all the way down.\nSo it is hardly surprising that Trump cares little about climate change. In fact, its hard to imagine culturing in a Petri dish an issue for which Trump might harbor more scorn and disinterest.\nThe significance of NCA4, in the end, is less about the content of this particular report, but rather in the embrace of ignorance, insouciance, and ill-preparation that the Trump treatment of climate science represents. NCA4 adds to the long history in America of chronically neglecting social, political and environmental problems: from slavery and Jim Crow, to housing bubbles and crumbling infrastructure, to the harms of smoking and industrial pollution. We have learned through avoidable financial panics, unnecessarily devastating hurricanes and anguishing internecine conflicts that such ills can be deferred, but they eventually have to be addressed-often after much hardship and loss-through hard choices, collective sacrifice for the common good, and concerted effort and vigilance of the body politic. These latter virtues are not richly embodied by the Trump administration, a fact that its climate change anti-policy starkly demonstrates. The real questions regarding our governing cabal are thus not so much whether the NCA4 findings are suppressed, but the following: On whose watch will the bill for climate change impacts come due, and how bad will the damage be?\n\nAndrew Eil is an independent consultant with expertise in climate change and clean energy policy, international development and sustainable investing.

Occasionally, they heard the sharp roars of glacial ice breaking off in monster chunks, then echoing across the peaks where they trained jumps, tricks and turns for the Pyeongchang Olympics. Most days, they basked in brilliant, snow-melting sunshine that bathed the whole scene in deceptive beauty.\nAnother subtle but telltale indicator of climate change\'s disruptive impact on winter sports: Many athletes  here 5,000 miles away from the Rockies and 3,500 miles from the Green Mountains of New England  had the letters "USA" emblazoned on their jackets. Americans once had little need to swap continents to guarantee offseason access to snow. But warming is forcing athletes to hunt farther from home for wintry conditions, particularly just months away from an Olympics.\n"Without the snow and the cold in the places in the States where it\'s normally cold, we have to travel over here and find a place on a glacier to get a couple of jumps off," said Jon Lillis, world champion in aerials skiing who trains in Utah. "Something that terrifies every winter athlete daily is the fact that the conditions are not as good as they used to be. You see videos of people skiing on glaciers back in the \'80s and \'70s, and half of that glacier doesn\'t even exist anymore ."\nLast year, the aerials team stopped water training at its headquarters in Park City in mid-October, then sat and waited a month for snow that came late to the mountain that hosted the Winter Games 15 years ago. The World Cup season began in China, and the Americans were forced to travel there not having set foot on snow in months. The results, not surprisingly, were dismal: not a single podium and only one finish in the top 5.\nLesson learned: This season, they uprooted to glaciers at Saas-Fee, Switzerland, and Ruka, Finland, for autumn training needed to be competitive at February\'s Winter Games in South Korea.\nThe hunt for offseason training spots like these is increasingly a scramble, and not just for the Americans. The hellishly named "Lucifer" heat wave that baked Europe in July and August wreaked havoc on teams\' schedules. Canadian skicross racers had to cancel plans to train on Italy\'s Stelvio glacier that turned a sickly gray, rerouting to Mount Hood, Oregon, instead. Canadians endured issues elsewhere, scrubbing a planned summer training trip to Argentina because of hostile weather and extreme winds.\nFrance\'s moguls team cut short a July training camp on its home glacier in Tignes after a crevasse opened under the course, which this year had just one jump instead of the usual two because of a shortage of snow, said team member Ben Cavet.\nHe was shocked by the visible deterioration of his regular venue for summer training .\n"It\'s crazy, you know? I always thought global warming was like your granddad going, \'Oh, I used to go and ski here 20 or 30 years ago and there was more snow,\'" Cavet said in an interview. "But now we really are talking eight years. I can see a huge difference. Up on the glacier, now there\'s this huge cliff, you know like a big rock, that you couldn\'t even see before."\n"It is worrying, very worrying," he added. "What scares me about global warming is that you can see that the world is suffering in some of the most beautiful places on Earth."\nOther glaciers suffered, too:\n Austria\'s Moelltaler Glacier closed from Aug. 15-Sept. 7 because of what its operators said were "water gutters in the ice" and other safety concerns.\n The Stubai Glacier, also in Austria, is deteriorating. U.S. coach Mike Jankowski, who brought some of the snowboarders and freeskiers there after the Saas-Fee trip, said there are concerns that some of the big buildings, drilled into the permafrost on the glacier, might not be stable for much longer.\n Italy\'s Stelvio, billed as the Alps\' largest summer skiing area, shut for 21 days in August , a sobering first since the opening of its lifts in the 1950s. Italian athletes who still came to train were hauled up on snow-cats.\n"Partly it was because of the heat," said Umberto Capitani, in charge of the ski area. "But it\'s also been three years that we\'ve had very little snowfall."\n The Horstman Glacier in Whistler, Canada, near the 2010 Olympic Alpine venue, has deteriorated so badly that a renowned recreational snowboard camp was canceled , and other activities curtailed.\n"There used to be like nine lanes for different camps there, and now it\'s five or six," said U.S. moguls skier Troy Murphy. "We still go there. It\'s still pretty good. But the amount it\'s shrunk, the snow is so much lower."\n Glaciers of the French Alps lost an average of 25 percent of their surface area between 2003 and 2015, and the rate of shrinkage nearly tripled, according to a study being readied for publication early next year.\nFrench researcher Antoine Rabatel said it is "highly probable" that the same trends will show up at glaciers elsewhere in Europe, as winters get shorter and summers hotter.\nWinter sports training, he said, is "going to become harder and harder."\nThe quest for reliable spots is becoming more competitive, and securing training locales is increasingly using up coaches\' time and budgets.\n"I need to be progressive and search out new spots," said Jankowski, who has had to add more reliable European venues to a global travel schedule that already includes trips to New Zealand and other locations in the Southern Hemisphere.\nIn October, skiing and snowboard athletes from the U.S. and dozens of other nations lined up before dawn, doing warmup exercises in the dark as they waited, to squeeze aboard the first gondola up to Saas-Fee\'s glacier. It also is in retreat , no longer reaching down to above the no-cars-allowed resort town, as it did in the 1930s.\nEnvironmentally minded athletes are wrestling with the moral dilemma of contributing to atmospheric pollution with their widening search for snow.\n"We take planes to go overseas. We take cars every day to go training," said French snowboard-cross racer Pierre Vaultier, gold medalist at the 2014 Sochi Games. "We are not examples about how to decrease global warming."\nU.S. gold-medal snowboarder Jamie Anderson said it\'s easy to get "sucked into the system, whether you want to or not."\n"It\'s hard to get out until you consciously make the decision," Anderson said. "With how passionate I am about snowboarding, it\'s hard to make that shift."\nWell aware of the impact snow sports are having on the environment, Burton Snowboards recently announced a series of changes aimed at diminishing its environmental footprint.\nThe growing frequency of warm winters has, indeed, hurt the financial health of the industry, including ski resorts that form the backbone of the recreational side of the sport. A study commissioned by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the athletes\' group Protect Our Winters found that skier visits in New Hampshire were 17 percent lower and ski resort revenue was $54 million less in the "low-snow" winters of 2001-02 and 2006-07, as compared with higher snowfall winters of 2007-08 and 2008-09. The differences between low- and high-snow seasons in Colorado were 8 percent in visits and $154 million in revenue.\nThe increased frequency of warm-weather race disruptions on the pro circuits also is causing alarm. Mild temperatures and lack of snow in Germany, Croatia and Michigan hit the 2015-16 season with multiple cancellations and venue changes. Last season began with events in Colorado and Alberta scrubbed because of lack of snow. This season\'s early Alpine event in Beaver Creek, Colorado, was run on almost all man-made snow that turned glassy in the warming sunshine.\nBiathlon venues such as Ruhpolding in Germany and Ostersund, Sweden, commonly now make thousands of cubic yards of snow at the end of winter and store it through summer beneath tarps and wood chips for early-season races the next winter.\n"We used to have relatively reliable conditions at all biathlon venues around the world," said Max Cobb, the president of U.S. Biathlon. "You can\'t count on it anymore."\nTemperatures in the 40s and 50s greeted freestyle skiers and snowboarders at their world championships in Spain last March, creating mushy conditions like those that took some of the shine off the 2014 Sochi Games and the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver.\n"It\'s a scary thing right now for winter sports. There\'s fewer and fewer places and all the glaciers are melting," U.S. aerials coach Matt Saunders said in Saas-Fee. "It\'s definitely getting harder and harder to get on snow early, for sure. We are having to travel further and further."\nScientists warn that worse is to come for winter sports, and that more warming will render proven Olympic venues unsuitable , even with greater use of artificial snow-making. Much has been said about the scarcity of snow in Beijing and surrounding areas, which will host the 2022 Winter Games, though officials have frequently brushed off the problem and promised to make enough artificial snow.\nPark City is in the mix for the 2026 and 2030 Olympics. The irony is not lost on Olympians who live there but had to travel the globe to train for Pyeongchang.\n"In my career, a lot of times, it\'s been really easy to chalk things up to it being a bad winter," said U.S. aerialist Mac Bohonnon. "But (warming is) undeniable. And the more I\'ve traveled, the more I\'ve seen that it\'s a pretty common theme wherever you go."\nCREDIT: Eddie Pells and John Leicester, Associated Press\n'b'Blue collar worker had enough with climate change \nEditor: \nI am a blue-collar workerNa guy who gets his hands dirty on a daily basisNand I have a question for my fellow blue-collar workers:E \nAt what point are we going to speak up and say to our governments, "ENOUGH!"? \nWe know that many politicians don\'t support us, or the efforts of our families.

Then it suggests that coal communities are filled with biased workers who value money over climate.E \nThe article then talks about the NDP giving Hanna a $450,000 grant to diversify the local coal-based economy. \nWhen compared, the amounts of this taxpayer-funded grant and the actual cost of the shutdowns are miles apart. There are individual families in these communities who will likely lose an amount equal to 10% of that grant or more just on the value of their homes.E \nHuge numbers of people are losingNowners and workers at support industries, devaluation of property and business holdings.

This being true, it raises the question: Is his editorial version of "connecting the dots" simply a best guessNan alarmist\'s fantasy? \nThis question is one of many that I\'ve been asked by my fellow blue-collar workers.

Thousands of people from B.C. to California have fled homes as fires rage. \nGreenland is experiencing the largest blaze ever recorded, one that Prof. Stef Lhermitte of Delft University in the Netherlands  called "a rare and unusual event." \nFires have spread throughout Europe, North America and elsewhere. \nIn June, dozens of people died in what\'s being called Portugal\'s worst fire ever. Meanwhile, from Saskatchewan to Vietnam to New Zealand, floods have brought landslides, death and destruction. \nWhat will it take to wake us up to the need to address climate change? Fires and floods have always been here, and are often nature\'s way of renewing ecosystems - but as the world warms, they\'re increasing in frequency,  size and severity. Experts warn wildfires could double in number in the near future, with the Pacific Northwest seeing five or six times as many. \nIn the western U.S., annual average temperatures have increased by 2 C and the fire season has grown by three months since the 1970s, leading to "new era of western wildfires," according to a recent study led by University  of Colorado Boulder wildfire experts, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \nClimate change doesn\'t necessarily start the fires - lightning, unattended campfires, carelessly tossed cigarette butts and sparks from machinery are major causes - but it creates conditions for more and larger fires.  Lightning, which causes up to 35 per cent of Canada\'s wildfires and is responsible for 85 per cent of the area burned annually, increases as temperatures rise, with studies showing 12 per cent more lightning strikes for each degree Celsius of warming. \nDrier, shorter winters and earlier snowmelt extend fire seasons. \nAs the atmosphere warms, it holds more moisture, some of which it draws from forests and wetlands, and increasing precipitation is not enough to offset  the drying. \nThis means fuel sources ignite more easily and fires spread faster over greater areas. Outbreaks of pests such as mountain pine beetles - previously kept in check by longer, colder winters - have also killed and dried forests, adding fuel to the  fires. \nBecause trees and soils hold moisture on slopes, fires can also increase the risk of flash floods when rains finally arrive. \nThe human and economic impacts are staggering - from property destruction to firefighting and prevention to loss of valuable resources and ecosystems. As human populations expand further into wild areas, damages and costs are increasing. \nHealth impacts from smoke put people - especially children and the elderly - at risk and drive health-care costs up. Wildfires now kill more than 340,000 people a year, mainly from smoke inhalation. \nFires also emit CO2, creating feedback loops and exacerbating climate change. \nBoreal forests in Canada and Russia store large amounts of carbon and help regulate the climate, but they\'re especially vulnerable to wildfires. \nSuggested solutions are wide-ranging. \nThe authors of the PNAS study recommend letting some wildfires burn in areas uninhabited by people, setting more "controlled" fires to reduce undergrowth fuels and create barriers, thinning dense forests, discouraging development in fire-prone areas and strengthening building  codes. \nThese adaptive measures are important, as are methods to prevent people from sparking fires, but our primary focus should be on doing all we can to slow global warming. \nAccording to NASA, Earth\'s average surface temperature has risen by 1.1 C since the late 19th century, with most warming occurring over the past 35 years, and 16 of the 17 warmest years occurring since 2001.  Eight months of 2016 were the warmest on record. \nOceans have also been warming and acidifying quickly, Arctic ice has rapidly decreased in extent and thickness, glaciers are retreating worldwide, and sea levels have been rising at an accelerating pace. \nRecord high temperature events have been increasing while low temperature events have decreased, and extreme weather events are becoming more common in many areas. \nToday\'s wildfires are a wake-up call. If we are serious about our Paris Agreement commitments, we can\'t build more pipelines, expand oil sands, continue fracking or exploit extreme Arctic and deep-sea oil. \nDavid Suzuki is a scientist, broadcaster and author.\n'b'Terrorism and climate change are being debated in Canada and America in a political environment far from ideal. With partisanship increasing and the rise of social media each side seems trapped by its own hardened positions. I can\'t recall the last time I heard a constructive conversation between conservatives and liberals on these subjects. \nIt can feel that progress has stalled. Thus rather than trying to find common ground and doing the hard work of building consensus both sides rely on legislative power to force change. But anything accomplished by force can be undone in the next election?hardly the formula for lasting change. \nTerrorism and climate change are two of the great challenges facing my generation and the two issues have one thing in common. Each issue is taken seriously by one side and not taken seriously by the other side. \nTerrorism and climate change match traditional areas of interest for conservatives and liberals N namely security and the environment. Here in Alberta the NDP have implemented a carbon tax in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Though Alberta\'s economy is struggling our NDP government has decided not to delay action. The Wildrose Party has launched successful critiques of this policy and whipped up opposition to it. The exemptions for some industries and not others leave Albertans confused why some must bear the full brunt of the new tax while others do not. Neighbouring Premier Brad Wall has emerged as perhaps the most effective opponent to a carbon tax arguing, persuasively, that now is a terrible economic time to implement this tax. And that without reciprocal international actions all the carbon tax will do is make our domestic industries less competitive. \nSouth of the border President Donald Trump signed an executive order temporarily stopping all refugees from entering the U.S. It also stopped entry to nationals from seven countries with a history of terrorism for 90 days and banned refugees from Syria indefinitely. Liberals immediately eviscerated this executive order for its botched rollout, for excluding the countries where the 9/11 terrorists actually came from, for closing the door on the Earth\'s most vulnerable and the implicit discrimination in favouring admission for minority religions in Muslim majority countries. \nBecause security and the environment are traditional areas of interest for the left and right it\'s not surprising that each respective party has chosen to prioritize them. I\'m not arguing for moral equivalency between the NDP\'s carbon tax and Trump\'s immigration order, but what\'s clear is that both policies are clumsy first attempts to deal with a complicated problem. Thus criticizing each has been easy. Liberals can offer scathing critiques of Trump\'s immigration order N that you can\'t win this war against radical ideology with blanket bans that alienate our Muslim allies. OK, I agree, but then what\'s your plan to combat terrorism? Conservatives continue to pick apart the carbon tax as poorly timed, confusing, ineffective and inconsistent. OK, I agree, so what\'s your plan to reduce greenhouse gases? Criticism and skepticism are necessary, but we need more. \nThis problem is perfectly highlighted by the predictable responses by our political leaders. In response to Trump\'s immigration order Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted out "Diversity is our strength." Another useless platitude that doesn\'t tell me anything about his plan to combat this threat. Last week a conservative leader tweeted out a picture of himself reading "The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels." A book rife with dubious claims, which have been exposed. Neither seems to be able to say, \'OK, yes this is a serious problem. I don\'t agree with this strategy, but here\'s my alternative plan.\' Instead each side retreats to positions that basically look delusional. \nLook, it\'s perfectly legitimate to believe that climate change is a myth, or that it\'s not caused by human activity or that its dangers are overblown. But you\'re going to have to make your case. If you don\'t believe that radical Islam is a serious threat then say so. Tell us why the multiple terrorist attacks in Europe and the recruitment of thousands of its citizens who have joined the fight in Syria shouldn\'t be cause for concern. This is also a perfectly legitimate position, but you\'re going to have to make your case. \nI believe that we can find a solution between the false choice of xenophobia and the naivet? of open borders as Jason Kenney aptly put it. I also believe we can find a solution between the climate change hyper-alarmism of the left and the radical climate change skepticism on the right. But first we need to recognize the validity of each other\'s fears. And each challenge won\'t be met without the earnest engagement of both conservatives and liberals. \nOur leaders here and in America are good people, but as constituents it is our duty to tell them when they need to do better. Simply put, on these issues they need to raise their game. We need to begin telling ourselves and each other uncomfortable truths and prepare for the hard work we have ahead. \n@KrisSamraj is a writer.

He spoke about his role in dealing with climate change at the local level, specifically as mayor.\nHeartwell served as mayor from 2004 to 2016, and during this time he was appointed by the Obama administration to help develop strategies for U.S. cities to deal with climate change. He also attended the Warsaw and Paris climate change conferences to represent U.S. mayors.\nGVL/Hannah Zajac - George Heartwell, a member of President Obama's Climate Change Adaptation Task Force and of the American Bar Association Task Force on Sustainable Developement, gives a presentation on adapting to climate change to a group of GV students on Tuesday, Feb. 21, 2017.\nIn his presentation, Heartwell said he developed an environmental task force to help combat climate change back in 2004. He talked about the environmental initiatives he has helped start up in West Michigan, and the partnerships his administration had with many Michigan colleges.\nHe described the present dangers of climate change and what would happen if its ignored.\nWe're living on a planet whose ecological architecture has evolved to a level of intricate interdependencies of plant and animal life, Heartwell said. Destroy any one element, lose any single species, and a complex chain of events is launched, a sort of death spiral, that affects a host of other related species.\nHeartwell has visited several universities in Michigan and across the country, such as the University of Michigan and Calvin College, addressing climate change and how it affects the environment, history, science, laws and politics.\nDuring the Bush presidency, when former president George W. Bush pulled the U.S. out of the Kyoto Protocol, many U.S. mayors rose up against the presidents declaration that climate change was not a priority of the U.S. or that it didnt exist, Heartwell said. He said mayors in particular are responsible for the well-being of their citizens, and climate change is an occurrence that has a direct influence on peoples lifestyles.\nThe president didn't have to figure out how to stretch an already tight municipal budget to fund infrastructure improvements to protect against floods, but that's what mayors must do, what mayors are expected to do, Heartwell said.\nMayors across the U.S. signed an agreement, similar to the Kyoto Protocol, that called for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere to slow the warming of the earths temperature.\nHeartwell said he was the 123rd mayor to sign the climate protection agreement of U.S. mayors when he took office in 2004. Today, there are 1,060 signatories to the agreement.\nNo mayor will cave to the federal government if they feel their citizens are at risk, Heartwell said.\nStudies by the Pew Research Center and Yale University show the majority of Americans believe climate change is real and man-made, yet President Trump has called climate change just weather and in the past has called climate change a concept perpetrated by the Chinese.\nIn an article published by Reuters, the Trump administration said it plans to roll back a series of environmental regulations set by former President Barack Obama concerning coal manufacturing on federal lands and greenhouse gas emissions.\nDespite the rollback, Heartwell said he is still optimistic. He said the juggernaut of American resistance against Trump has been unleashed.\nPeople are ready to take to the streets to resist environmental tyranny, Heartwell said.\nKenneth Piers is a member of the Citizens Climate Lobby, which tries to work with Congress to create a carbon fee and dividend policy on fossil fuels. He has worked as a chemistry professor at Calvin College since 1968 and began his teaching on climate change during the 1980s. He said while climate change is based on science and evidence, climate change denial is completely manufactured by the oil industry and big money and has no evidence supporting it.\nPiers said the climate science community is nearly unanimous in saying climate change is real and the human race has very little time to turn things around.\nMr. Heartwell says he's optimistic, Piers said. People ask me that, too, and I say I am optimistic about what the American people will do if they're told the truth. If they're told the truth, they'll do the right thing.\nThe geography and sustainable planning department at GVSU, and more specifically the Global Environmental Change class taught by professor Elena Lioubimtseva, hosted Heartwells visit. Lioubimtseva said shes met Heartwell in the past and still follows his work on climate change. She said he is one of many well-known experts on climate change.\nIt's a very important topic of conversation, and I think Heartwell is one of the best people to engage and inspire students and really encourages us to think about what really needs to be done, Lioubimtseva said.\nThe event was attended by many of Lioubimtsevas students, but other community members, members of local government, environmental groups and students who came out of general interest attended the event as well.\nHeartwell said he hopes students understand the urgency of climate change while still having hope for the future.\nIn spite of what the administration is doing right now, there is an irreversible movement that's underway in this country, and there's nothing President Trump can do to turn that around, Heartwell said.\nCredit: Dylan Grosser\n"b'If President Trump announces Thursday that he has decided to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, the move would likely enjoy broad support among Republican voters.\nPulling out of the climate accord would also be seen as a reward to "Trump country": voters in industrial states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin or rural areas where environmental regulations are viewed as economically harmful.\nPolling on the Paris Agreement, which aims to reduce the negative effects of climate change caused by human activity, is inconsistent. But there is scant evidence Republicans would miss U.S. participation. Trump campaigned on withdrawal, defeating Hillary Clinton, the Democrat who pledged fidelity to it.\nEven upscale suburban GOP voters suspicious of Trump and more interested in combating climate change than other Republicans aren\'t likely to shed tears over a U.S. pullout from Paris.\n"The suburban Republicans Trump can get may value a cleaner environment. But they sure don\'t want the Dutch mandating how we get there," said GOP consultant Brad Todd, who has worked campaigns in Florida, where elections are driven by suburban voters and the environment is a key issue.\nA Republican strategist with similar experience, who was not authorized by his clients to speak publicly on the matter, said climate change is salient among the sort of Republican that resisted Trump in November and has continued to do so.\nThe problem is international directives. Republicans concerned about the environment are likely to fear Paris could hurt them in the pocketbook by placing the lion\'s share of the economic burden on American taxpayers.\n"Many upscale suburban Republicans are convinced human actions are changing the climate and they want their representatives to do something about it," this strategist said. "But they\'re less convinced that an international treaty written in Paris offers a magic formula to solve all the problems."\nA HuffPost/YouGov opt-in online poll conducted in mid-May found that 61 percent of Americans said the country should stay in the agreement, 17 percent supported withdrawal and 21 percent were unsure. But only 31 percent of self-described Trump voters backed Paris; 46 percent supported exiting, and 22 percent were unsure.\nTrump faces three basic options for removing the U.S. from the Paris Agreement. He could send it to the Senate to be approved as a formal treaty, where it would likely fail to attract the 67 votes necessary for ratification.\nOr the president could exit the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, a decades-old treaty from which Paris derives authority. This method would dramatically shorten the timeline of withdrawal, but could cause a diplomatic backlash from the remaining signatories.\nFinally, Trump could follow steps laid out in Paris for countries that want to exit the agreement.\nThat would require waiting three years from the effective date of the agreement, November 2016, at which point the administration could send a letter expressing its intention to withdraw. Withdrawal wouldn\'t be official for an additional 12 months.\nThe president could face criticism from the Right if he follows this path because it would involve lending credence to the legal legitimacy of the accords.\nMyron Ebell, who led Trump\'s EPA transition team, said placing the fate of the agreement in the Senate could provide Trump with political cover. He could fulfill his campaign promise and policy inclination to exit Paris, but explain to critics at home and abroad that there simply wasn\'t enough domestic support to remain.\n"The way this is portrayed right now, it\'s President Trump against the entire world, he\'s the only person who\'s trying to destroy the planet," Ebell said. "Once the Senate voted, it would be the Senate\'s responsibility.\n"I think actually it\'s the easiest way to do that; it\'s a way to share the responsibility rather than taking it all on the White House," he added.\nThe U.S. joined the United Nations-organized Paris Agreement under former President Barack Obama. Democrats argue that the science of man-made climate change is settled and national economies and populations could suffer if something isn\'t done before it\'s too late to mitigate its ill effects.\nThis view never caught on among Republicans. Some believe the notion of man-made climate change is a sham; some prioritize the jobs and economic growth that come from fossil fuels exploration over environmental concerns.\nSome are concerned but aren\'t convinced government action is the answer. Some are convinced the government should do something but don\'t trust developing nations, which have less-stringent environmental regulations than the U.S. to share the burden of addressing climate change fairly.\n"While some think the climate is changing, most don\'t think it\'s all from man-made causes. The fact no one can say by how much or even measure the human impact on the climate, makes us all cynical," David Carney, a Republican consultant, said, explaining the view from the Right. "The near-religious outrage by the Left on this matter makes even more of us think something is a miss."\nIndeed, Nick Loris, a policy analyst who focuses on energy and the environment at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, doesn\'t take issue with climate change science.\nLoris\' problem is that he doesn\'t believe Paris will solve the problem, while costing the average American family $20,000 by 2035.\n"Paris is the open door for egregious regulation, cronyism, and government spending that would be disastrous for the American economy as it is proving to be for those in Europe," Loris said.\nNevertheless, Trump\'s own administration has been split on what to do about Paris. While it has been assumed the president was leaning in favor of leaving all along, there were factions that wanted to renegotiate the deal or even stay in it as currently written.\nTrump said he will announce is final decision at 3 p.m. on Thursday from the Rose Garden at the White House.\nCredit: Sarah Westwood, David M. Drucker, Poliical Correspondent\n'b'President Trump and his advisers are debating whether to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord, and if he does the fury will be apocalyptic--start building arks for the catastrophic flood. The reality is that withdrawing is in America\'s economic interest and won\'t matter much to the climate.\nPresident Obama signed the agreement last September, albeit by ducking the two-thirds majority vote in the Senate required under the Constitution for such national commitments. The pact includes a three-year process for withdrawal, which Mr. Trump could short-circuit by also pulling out of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\nParis was supposed to address the failures of the 1997 Kyoto protocol, which Bill Clinton signed but George W. Bush refused to implement amid similar outrage. The Kyoto episode is instructive because the U.S. has since reduced emissions faster than much of Europe thanks to business innovation--namely, hydraulic fracturing that is replacing coal with natural gas.\nWhile legally binding, Kyoto\'s CO2 emissions targets weren\'t strictly enforced. European countries that pursued aggressive reductions were engaging in economic masochism. According to a 2014 Manhattan Institute study, the average cost of residential electricity in 2012 was 12 cents per kilowatt hour in the U.S. but an average 26 cents in the European Union and 35 cents in Germany. The average price of electricity in the EU soared 55% from 2005 to 2013.\nYet Germany\'s emissions have increased in the last two years as more coal is burned to compensate for reduced nuclear energy and unreliable solar and wind power. Last year coal made up 40% of Germany\'s power generation compared to 30% for renewables, while state subsidies to stabilize the electric grid have grown five-fold since 2012.\nBut the climate believers tried again in Paris, this time with goals that are supposedly voluntary. China and India offered benchmarks pegged to GDP growth, which means they can continue their current energy plans. China won\'t even begin reducing emissions until 2030 and in the next five years it will use more coal.\nPresident Obama, meanwhile, committed the U.S. to reducing emissions by between 26% and 28% below 2005 levels by 2025. This would require extreme changes in energy use. Even Mr. Obama\'s bevy of anti-carbon regulations would get the U.S. to a mere 45% of its target.\nMeeting the goals would require the Environmental Protection Agency to impose stringent emissions controls on vast stretches of the economy including steel production, farm soil management and enteric fermentation (i.e., cow flatulence). Don\'t laugh--California\'s Air Resources Board is issuing regulations to curb bovine burping to meet its climate goals.\nAdvocates in the White House for remaining in Paris claim the U.S. has the right to unilaterally reduce Mr. Obama\'s emissions commitments. They say stay in and avoid the political meltdown while rewriting the U.S. targets.\nBut Article 4, paragraph 11 of the accord says "a party may at any time adjust its existing nationally determined contribution with a view to enhancing its level of ambition." There is no comparable language permitting a reduction in national targets.\nRest assured that the Sierra Club and other greens will sue under the Section 115 "international air pollution" provision of the Clean Air Act to force the Trump Administration to enforce the Paris standards. The "voluntary" talk will vanish amid the hunt for judges to rule that Section 115 commands the U.S. to reduce emissions that "endanger" foreign countries if those countries reciprocate under Paris. After his experience with the travel ban, Mr. Trump should understand that legal danger.\n***\nThe Big Con at the heart of Paris is that even its supporters concede that meeting all of its commitments won\'t prevent more than a 0.17 degree Celsius increase in global temperatures by 2100, far less than the two degrees that is supposedly needed to avert climate doom.\nIt\'s also rich for Europeans to complain about the U.S. abdicating climate leadership after their regulators looked the other way as auto makers, notably Volkswagen, cheated on emissions tests. This allowed Europeans to claim they were meeting their green goals without harming the competitiveness of their auto makers. The EPA had to shame the EU into investigating the subterfuge.\nThe U.S. legal culture will insist on carbon compliance even if Europe and China cheat. Even if Mr. Trump would succeed in rewriting U.S. emissions targets, his successor could ratchet them back up. That possibility might deter some companies from investing in long-term fossil-fuel production.\nThe simplest decision is to make a clean break from Paris. But if Mr. Trump doesn\'t want to take the political heat for withdrawing on his own, here\'s a compromise: Atone for Mr. Obama\'s dereliction and submit Paris to the Senate for approval as a treaty. Then we can see whether anticarbon virtue-signaling beats real-world economic costs for Democrats from energy states like Heidi Heitkamp (North Dakota), Joe Manchin (West Virginia) and Joe Donnelly (Indiana).\n'b'It\'s not because of the winter weather -- that\'s the first thing Texan Katharine Hayhoe wants Winnipeggers to know about why she is appearing by video next week at the Canadian Mennonite University, instead of coming in person.\n"It\'s a way to practise what I preach," says the renowned director of the Climate Science Centre at Texas Tech University in Lubbock.\n"There is always an irony when I fly somewhere to tell people not to fly so much so we can preserve God\'s creation."\nThe 44-year-old Hayhoe, who is originally from Toronto, is the 2017 Scientist in Residence at the CMU. She will be speaking to students on Monday and Tuesday, and hosting a public lecture Wednesday at 7 p.m. titled "Talking Climate: Why Facts are Not Enough."\nAlthough she\'s done many presentations by video before, this is the first time she\'s done it as a scientist in residence -- which she thinks is a great thing.\n"I\'d encourage more groups to do this," she says, noting that it is not only less expensive but it reduces carbon dioxide emissions, as well.\nWhat makes Hayhoe unique and so well-known -- in 2014 Time  magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people -- is that she is an evangelical Christian, a group in the U.S. not known for being accepting of the issue of climate change.\nSurveys in that country show only 28 per cent of white evangelicals say humans are responsible for climate change. That\'s the lowest of all American Christian groups.\nWhy is that the case? After all, the Bible has a lot to say about how God loves and cares about creation, and evangelicals say they take the Bible seriously.\nFor Hayhoe, the reason is due to the way politics and religion is mixed in America.\n"I see a difference between theological evangelicals and political evangelicals," she says.\nTheological evangelicals, she explains, "take the Bible seriously. They love God, and love others. But many evangelicals in the U.S. today are political evangelicals. Their main source of authority is not the Bible, but what some political parties or leaders say, or a particular political ideology. And these are the people telling them climate change isn\'t real."\nA theological evangelical, on the other hand, sees "humans are made in image of God, and that we are responsible for every living thing on the planet, we are stewards or caretakers of creation."\nFor her, "objections to the science of climate change have nothing to do with being religiously evangelical. They have everything to do with being politically evangelical. They oppose it not on a religious basis, but a political basis."\nBecause she spends much of her time speaking to churches about climate change, Hayhoe has been given the moniker of "climate-change evangelist" -- something she doesn\'t think really fits.\n"An evangelist is someone who spreads the good news, but I feel like an Old Testament prophet saying that you need to heed my warning... the clock is ticking. Every year that passes by without action means we are losing time to try to fix this problem," she says.\nAnd yet, she is hopeful. "There is good news about how people are doing things to help the planet," she says.\nShe is also optimistic that more evangelicals will come around and see climate change as an important issue.\n"I believe that as Christians we are given a new heart by God, and with it comes a desire to love and help people and care for God\'s creation," she says.\nThis includes caring for others, including those affected by climate change.\n"If we look on the effect of climate change on the poor and vulnerable in the developing world, all the climate-change refugees, people suffering from drought, those near coastlines whose homes are being flooded as the seas rise, these are the people who our hearts should desire to help because of who we are as Christians, and as humans," she says.\n"As Christians who want to share God\'s love in the world, when we see suffering how can we turn away and not help?"\nAnd one way to do that, she states, is by caring about a changing climate.\nFor more information about Hayhoe\'s presentations, visit www.cmu.ca.\njdl562000@yahoo.com\nCredit: John Longhurst\n'b"I write in response to Alan Panther's letter published January 6 entitled 'Enough Global Warming'. He seems to make the case that The Border Mail is complicit in perpetuating a systematic ignorance of evidence against the existence of climate change, specifically global warming.\nAny argument against the reality of anthropogenic climate change is a dangerous argument that should not be left unchallenged. It should first be noted that there is a difference between weather and climate, just as there is a difference between data and evidence.\nThat it has been a particular severe winter in some parts of the northern hemisphere is not evidence that global warming does not exist. If year on year, decade upon decade, the average global temperature decreased or was stable, we might have evidence global warming was non-existent or in recession.\nThe reality is unfortunately that average global temperatures have been steadily increasing for decades. Pointing to one weather event as evidence to the contrary is like pointing to Don Bradman's duck in his last innings as evidence that he was not a good batsman. While this is a flippant rebuttal on my part for sure, climate change is no joke and I would urge anyone skeptical of the science of climate change to consider that climate scientists spend their entire careers, even lives, researching and understanding the phenomena.\nThe robust evidence produced by this research should not be dismissed so casually. Doing so is ignorant at best, and dangerous at worst.\nIn response to the suggestion that The Border Mail purposefully ignores evidence supporting the non-existence of climate change, as above, as yet there is no evidence disputing the existence of climate change.\nAny and all 'evidence' you may find to this effect has been thoroughly debunked by the scientific community. Furthermore, The Border Mail published your letter. Not really the action of an agency with an alleged agenda to ignore a misguided reality.\nI'm of two minds as to whether publishing of your letter was wise, given it has perhaps lent credibility to a patently absurd and dangerous position. I can only hope that my response has perhaps, as you put it, 'set the record straight' in the minds of those who believe as you do.\nYour editorial ('Greens miss mark with Australia Day push') on January 17 started with the question about whether Greens leader Richard Di Natalie considers that changing the date of Australia Day is among the most important issues facing the country.\nI suggest probably not, but why ask?\nAre you suggesting that the Greens should not discuss symbolic issues such as this one and should only focus on what you consider to be the most important issues? Malcolm Turnbull has waded into the same debate but I haven't heard anyone say that he shouldn't comment on it because it's not important enough.\nIf you are going criticise one party for discussing something you don't consider important you should apply the same standard to all of them.\nThe winner of the letter of the week is Danny Bowden. You can collect your prize from the offices of The Border Mail at 1 McKoy Street in Wodonga.\n"b'Morocco, Nov. 6 -- By Sana El Ouazi\nRabat - Morocco\'s "Climate Champion" at the United Nations, Hakima El Haite, will not represent the kingdom at the global climate change conference COP23 which opens Monday in Bonn, Germany, reported the British online media Climate Change News.\nThe Former Minister Delegate for the Environment and Special Envoy of Morocco for climate change was expected to attend the event, led under the presidency of Fiji, as a UN "High-Level Climate Change Champion," a title awarded to her by the governing body in 2016.\nHer role as a "Climate Champion" allowed her to guide a program encouraging partnerships between countries, regions, and companies to reduce emissions.\nBut last week, Haite found her name on the list government officials to whom the Royal Cabinet announced that "no official responsibility would be entrusted to them in the future."\nThe officials, including three ministers, were dismissed after failing to improve the situation of the country\'s northern regions and the numerous malfunctions operated at the "Al Hoceima Manarat Al Moutawassit" development project inaugurated in 2015 in Morocco\'s north, according to a royal statement.\nEl Haite announced on Friday that she was closing her Climate Champion Twitter account dedicated to her activities for the Global Climate Action Plan.\n"I close this account shortly. To continue to follow my activities, follow me on @HakimaElHaite. Thank you for your loyalty," she said.\nThe UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) confirmed that El Haite will not be able to attend to COP 23 and that her absence will be filled by other Moroccan officials.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Morocco World News.\nFor any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at content.services@htlive.com\n'b'It would be hard to argue that the Trudeau government isn\'t gung-ho about fighting climate change. Among other marquee moves since taking power, it obliged the provinces and territories to impose a price on carbon pollution by this year, under threat of doing it for them, and announced, in its 2017 budget, a $21.9-billion, 11-year investment in green-energy infrastructure.\nAs well, the Liberals regularly vow to "restore science as a pillar of government decision-making," the words used by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last September when he named the country\'s new chief science adviser.\nGiven this, it\'s hard to understand why Ottawa isn\'t renewing the Climate Change and Atmospheric Research program, the only dedicated federal program that funds long-term, large-scale research into the effects of climate change.\nThe $35-million program expires this year, after funding seven major projects over five years, most of them in the Arctic. So far no one in the government has explained why this is happening. Tellingly, though, last fall Ottawa gave the most high-profile CCAR-funded project, the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory (PEARL) in Eureka, Nunavut, an 18-month extension.\nThe PEARL is the most northern civilian-run research station in Canada, and its data is used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the World Meteorological Office. Defunding it would have caused an international controversy - exactly the way it did in 2011 when the Harper government threatened to do that very thing.\nThe outcry was so loud that it helped prompt the Conservatives to create CCAR. The Trudeau government clearly did not want to suffer the same global opprobrium. It does appear, though, that it wants to quietly get out of the business of funding major university-led climate-change research, and instead rely on smaller one-off projects, and on work done by federal scientists, to inform its policies.\nGiven that Canada claims sovereignty over the Arctic, it\'s a shortsighted decision. It\'s not the end of the world that six research projects are coming to an end this year. What\'s tragic is that Ottawa won\'t be funding new ones that pick up where they left off, and instead will let their findings and the hundreds of grad students they trained be scattered to the winds, or into the hands of researchers in other countries.\nCanada needs sustained, large-scale research on climate change done in this country, led by Canadians. Ottawa should extend CCAR, or replace it, before the year is out.\n'b'Bonn:"Canada is back" -- that memorable refrain from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Paris marking the country\'s return to proactively pushing a climate agenda. More recently, with the United States taking a back seat on climate, Canada has sought to step into a leadership role.\nCanada, along with the United Kingdom, launched the Global Alliance to Power Past Coal. On Thursday, 20 countries and sub-national governments joined the alliance committing to reduce their dependency on coal-fired power, halt the building of power plants, or phase out coal altogether. It is a declaration of intent to move to a decarbonised economy. "Nowhere is that transition more important than in Canada, where the federal government\'s leadership in this global alliance needs to be matched by real emissions reductions at home. As negotiations unfold with provinces on the logistics of meeting the national 2030 phaseout deadline, all jurisdictions need to be held to the same high standard to make sure we are all moving to a clean future together," said Catherine Abreu, executive director, CAN-Rac Canada.\nAt the current round of climate talks, Canada did not break ranks with other industrialised countries to provide more funding to help poor developing countries adapt to climate change, or help fund instruments that would help countries deal with climate change impact in situations.\nCreating a mandate of the Adaptation Fund, the Kyoto-era mechanism to help developing countries adapt to climate change under Paris Agreement is one of the key deliverables of the current round of talks chaired by Fiji. But Canada has maintained a studied silence on the issue. When asked about her country\'s views on the future of the Adaptation Fund, Canada\'s Environment Minister Catherine McKenna was non-committal. "Adaptation is key and we hear that from countries all the time; a number of our commitments have been projects related to adaptation," McKenna told ET. The Adaptation Fund is one of the key mechanisms that provides poor developing countries with the assistance required to take steps to adapt to changes that are already taking place on account of rising temperatures.\nA major leadership initiative by Canada was that of reviving the Major Economies Forum, an initiative by the US State Department. Under US President Barack Obama, the Major Economies Forum became the platform for countries address knotty political issues impeding global climate action. "In the advance to the Paris Agreement, it was a very helpful forum to talk about issues," explained the Canadian environment minister.\n'b'Twenty years ago, countries agreed to the first legally binding climate treaty at a summit in the Japanese city of Kyoto. Till 2015, when countries adopted the Paris Agreement, the Kyoto Protocol, as the 1997 treaty came to be known, provided the legal basis for addressing climate change. Now developing countries are asking that the treaty\'s twentieth anniversary be marked with a commemoration ceremony during the current round of climate talks.\nEcuador, as chair of the developing country grouping G-77 and China, has written to the UN climate secretariat suggesting that a special event be held to mark 20 years of the iconic climate treaty.\nConfirming that G-77\'s representation to the UN climate change secretariat, a senior official privy to the contents said, "We have marked the anniversary of landmark environment agreements, be it the 1992 Rio Convention, the Montreal Protocol. So there is no reason not to commemorate the twenty years of the Kyoto Protocol."\nThe UN climate secretariat is looking into the request. Sources said that there are plans to mark the adoption of the iconic treaty in December. The Kyoto Protocol was adopted on December 11, 1997. However, they were looking into the request made by countries for a ceremony at Bonn during the current round of talks.\nThe Kyoto Protocol is the first legally binding agreement that addressed the issue of greenhouse gas emissions contributing to global warming and climate change.\n"This year is the 20th year of the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol, we also propose to have a ceremony to celebrate the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol. I think what is most important is that we need to do something to commemorate this very important historical moment," said Chen Zhihua, senior Chinese negotiator.\nThe call to commemorate the anniversary of the iconic climate treaty comes amidst the demand by developing countries for a formal discussion on the efforts that are currently being implemented by countries to slow down climate change. The Kyoto Protocol set out mandatory emission reduction targets for industrialised countries.\nDeveloping countries have come together in a show of unity to demand that current round of climate talks formally allocate time and space to discussions on pre-2020 agenda that includes the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol.\nThey argue that the focus of the climate talks has been skewed, focused on climate action in the post-2020 period under the Paris Agreement while actions in the pre-2020 period are not getting much attention. Developing countries have argued that meeting the goals set in the Paris Agreement may be difficult if more is not done in three years before the 2015 agreement becomes operational.\n"I think action is the best way to commemorate the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol," said Chen Zhihua.\nThe Kyoto Protocol emerged from the United Framework Convention on Climate Change that all countries agreed to in 1992 at Rio summit and referred to popularly as the Earth Summit. The UN Climate Convention pledges to take measures to limit the amount of greenhouse gas emissions to prevent dangerous and irreversible climate change--"stabilise greenhouse-gas concentrations "at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system". The Convention also set out the principle of common but differentiated responsibility and respective capability.\nThis meant that the developed industrialised countries were to take the lead in reducing emissions. While developing countries would take action depending on the financial and technological support they received from developed countries. Dealing with economic and social development, and poverty eradication were seen as the "first and overriding priorities" of the developing countries.\nThe Kyoto Protocol was the legally binding instrument that gave shape to the principles enshrined in the Convention. It, unlike the successor climate treaty agreed to in Paris, sets out mandatory targets for emission reduction by industrialised countries. The United States was a signatory to when the treaty was adopted in Kyoto, never ratified the 1997 agreement.\nThe Kyoto Protocol became operational in 2005. Its initial mandate was till 2012, known in the UN parlance as the first commitment period. After protracted negotiations in December 2012 at Doha, countries agreed to extend the mandate of the Kyoto Protocol till 2020. The Doha Amendment is yet to be operationalized--only 84 countries out of the 144 required have ratified the treaty.\n'b'SAN FRANCISCO -- A day after President Donald Trump\'s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord, states and cities around the country said they would adhere to their own aggressive climate policies.\nTwenty states and Washington, D.C., have adopted their own greenhouse gas emission targets, according to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, and some press beyond the U.S. commitment under the accord, which sought to reduce greenhouse emissions 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025.\nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown is encouraging states to pursue their own climate standards, as well as developing his own international climate agenda and pushing tougher standards than the federal government had under the Obama administration.\nFollowing the Thursday announcement, Mr. Brown, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee said they would form a new coalition of states committed to upholding the American side of the Paris treaty deal.\nThe governors called the coalition the United States Climate Alliance, which they said will "act as a forum to sustain and strengthen existing climate programs, promote the sharing of information and best practices, and implement new programs to reduce carbon emissions from all sectors of the economy."\nFormer New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the United Nations secretary-general\'s special envoy for cities and climate change, said through an adviser on Friday that those three states, along with a coalition of at least 100 businesses and 30 cities would on Monday submit a letter of intent to the U.N. indicating the coalition would meet the U.S. goals through their own commitments.\nNot all states were upset with Mr. Trump\'s decision.\nIn West Virginia, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said the withdrawal would benefit the state\'s ailing coal industry. "West Virginians have suffered tremendous economic calamity as a result of the Obama administration\'s anti-coal agenda . . . ," the Republican senator said in a statement. "President Trump is standing with our West Virginia workers and businesses to keep jobs in our state."\nThe president said he left the agreement with the hope of boosting American industry and independence and called his decision a "reassertion of our sovereignty."\nTwenty-nine states have adopted renewable portfolio standards, which require utilities to sell a certain amount, or percentage, of renewable electricity, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n"States have been doing this for a long time and long before there has been consideration at the federal level," said Glen Andersen, energy program director at the NCSL.\nOther states are ramping up their renewable-energy generation because prices are competitive and such projects add jobs, said Rachel Cleetus, the lead economist and climate policy manager at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit.\nTexas, for instance, has become a leader in renewable-energy production, even without a legislative mandate. The state, which has a quarter of all the wind power in America, is getting 12.6% of its electricity from wind, according to the American Wind Energy Association.\n---\nValerie Bauerlein and Jim Carlton contributed to this article.\nCredit: By Alejandro Lazo\n'b'This is what global warming looks like,opinion pieces quickly declared in bothPoliticoandCNNabout devastating Hurricane Harvey.  A week later, newsmediaaround the globeandpoliticiansweresaying theexactsamething about Hurricane Irma. \nJumping the gun on linking disasters to climate change is dangerous.  It points us toward policies that will have little to no effect at reducing future devastation. \nThe science is clear but also nuanced: Climate change will worsen some extreme weather events, and it will improve others. \nMore: It\'s hard to see Hurricane Maria through all this smoke\nMore: After Hurricane Irma, let\'s rebuild smarter\nAn excellentpeer-reviewedanalysisin the journalWeather, Climate and Societyby University of Manchester scientists Vladimir Jankoviand David Schultz cites the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,the United Nations global panel of climate change experts, and find, Not all extreme weather events will change,nor will some of the changes-if they even occur - be detectable. \nThe researchers conclude, The sound bite of climate change means more extreme weather is a massive oversimplification - if not misstatement - of the true state of the science. \nGlobal warming, in general, willincrease temperatures most during winter, at night and in cold places.  Droughts are among themost costly natural disasters, but a comprehensivestudyinNatureshows that since 1982, examples of all drought categories have slightly decreased. \nHeat waves will increase, but cold waves will decrease.  Becausemany more people die from excessive coldthan excessive heat, it is likely that the amount of deaths will decline. \nAs for hurricanes such asHarvey and Irma: Before Harvey, the USA just ended a record 12-year absence of strong hurricanes.  Hurricanes are not hitting the U. S.  more -over the past 120years, major hurricane landfallshave declined from 7. 5 per decade to fiveper decade.  A similar decline is also true for all hurricanes and even true for the very most ferocious Category 4 and 5 hurricanes. \nStorms are causing more damage, but it has long been documented that this is entirely explained by more people with more wealth living closer to coastlines where hurricanes hit. \nIn Floridas Dade and Broward counties alone, today we will find more people than lived in 1930 inall109 coastal counties from Texas through Virginia, along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts.  In the U. S.  over the past century, the population has increased fourfold, but the coastal population has increased much more.  In Florida,for instance, it has increasedfiftyfold. \nUnsurprisingly, with more people living in more expensive homes, there are higher damage costs.  Adjusted for population and wealth,hurricane damagefrom 1900-2016 actually decreased.  In fact, the 12-year absence of hurricanesis the equivalent tothe United States being$70 billion better off than it otherwise would be from expected hurricane damage since 2006. \nMore: GOP denies climate change, America pays the price\nPOLICING THE USA:Alook atrace, justice, media\nLooking into the future, its likely thathurricanes will indeed become somewhat strongerby the end of the century.  They will also likely become less frequent, and societies will definitely become more robust.  A respectedNaturereviewshows that hurricane damage currently costs 0. 04% of global gross domestic product. Accounting for an increase in prosperity, this would drop fourfold to 0. 01% by 2100.  But the global warming factor making hurricanes fewer but stronger will mean total damage will end around 0. 02%. \nThis shows that global warming is a problem, but it also shows us that even accounting for this, damages will decline. \nThe problem with blaming a disaster such asHarvey or Irma on global warming is that this tells us the answer should be a global warming answer: carbon cuts.  And this is a terrible way of helping. \nResearch showsthat the Kyoto Protocol,the first major global deal to cut carbon and rein in temperatures (and, it would follow, help prevent hurricanes) failed to achieve a thing.  The Paris climate treaty is on track to cost the globeabout $1 trillion to $2 trillion per yearfor the rest of the century. The U. N. body responsible for the treatyestimatesthat the cuts promised until 2030 will achieve 1%of what would be needed to keep temperature rises under 2 Celsius,or 3. 6 Fahrenheit. \nWhat this suggests is that spending 1%-2% of GDP on climate policies could, at best, help avoid much, much less than 0. 01% of GDP lost to hurricanes.  That is an infuriatingly bad investment. \nIt is little wonder that aRoyal Society reportconcludes thatcutting CO2has "extremely limited potential to reduce future losses. \nTo tackle climate change, a moderate carbon tax could help a little, but will not significantly reduce CO2emissions.  Instead climate change will be tackled most effectively by investing in research and developing green energy sources to make them so cheap they will outcompete fossil fuels.  That way, everyone will want to make the switch away from fossil fuels. \nBlaming hurricane damage on global warming doesnt just mean we spend money poorly, but also that we miss the policies that would make a real difference.  Effectively tackling hurricane damage in rich countries is almost exclusively about reducing vulnerability, through better zoning (we shouldnt allow houses to be built on flood plains or right on the coast), better building codes, reducing federally subsidized insurance, and allowing for more wetlands and porous surfaces to handle flooding.  For the worlds poor, and the hardest hit from hurricane damage, policies that reduce poverty are the most effective way of building resilience. \nThese are the smart policies that would help the most.  And this is what responding to hurricanes needs to look like. \nBjorn Lomborg is director of the Copenhagen Consensus Center, author ofThe Skeptical Environmentalist,Cool It, andThe Nobel Laureates Guide to the Smartest Targets for the World 2016-30, and a visiting professor at Copenhagen Business School. \n\n'b'World Resources Institute issued the following news release:\nFollowing through on the landmark Paris Agreement means showing what countries are doing to meet their commitments and how they can ramp up ambition over time. For the first time, Climate Watch will bring together dozens of data sets onto one platform, including current and past greenhouse gas emissions, future emissions scenarios, sustainable development targets, progress towards meeting national climate pledges, information on climate risk and much more.\nClimate Watch will ensure policymakers and researchers are using the most accurate and comprehensive data for decision-making, and create the accountability and transparency necessary to combat climate change.\nClimate Watch is managed by World Resources Institute (WRI) in collaboration with partners: African Center for Technology Studies (ACTS), Climate Action Tracker, Climate Analytics, The German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ), The German Development Institute (DIE), Google, NDC Partnership, Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and The World Bank. A flagship initiative of the NDC Partnership, the platform will be showcased at numerous events and an exhibit during the COP23 climate conference in Bonn, Germany next week.\n"Obtaining up-to-date information remains one of the most important aspects in the implementation of NDCs," said Nezha El Ouafi, Secretary of State to Morocco\'s Minister of Energy, Mines and Sustainable Development and an NDC Partnership co-chair. "Through Climate Watch, the NDC Partnership provides data and resources to countries to achieve their climate and sustainable development goals at the national, regional and international levels."\n"Key to the success of the NDC Partnership is the ability to share knowledge and to learn from one another to accelerate climate action," said Thomas Silberhorn, Parliamentary State Secretary to Germany\'s Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development and an NDC Partnership co-chair. "This task requires comprehensive, up-to-date, and easily accessible data, which is why the Partnership supports tools like Climate Watch. This innovative resource provides fast access to the information countries need to implement their mitigation commitments."\nClimate Watch includes:\n* Data and visualizations on all countries\' greenhouse gas emissions;\n* A user-friendly database of all countries\' Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs);\n* Comprehensive mapping of linkages between Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and associated targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n* Data and visuals of emissions scenario pathways for major emitting countries, derived from a growing library of models;\n* National and sectoral profile pages that offer a snapshot of climate progress, risks and vulnerabilities; and\n* The ability to download data and create, save and share customized data visualizations through My Climate Watch.\nThere is growing recognition that countries\' developments goals will become unattainable unless climate change is addressed. Aligning climate targets with sustainable development goals is critical to pursue low-carbon economies and build climate resilience in ways that leave no one behind.\n"Reliable information is the foundation for sound policymaking no matter what your aim," said Paula Caballero, Global Director, Climate Program, World Resources Institute. "Climate Watch offers a wealth of credible climate data that will prove invaluable for national policymakers to track their progress, identify low-carbon pathways and ultimately drive action. In addition, as the go-to resource for climate data, Climate Watch will foster greater transparency and accountability as countries make progress towards achieving their Paris climate commitments."\nAccording to new WRI research conducted for the NDC Partnership and presented on Climate Watch, climate actions communicated in countries\' NDCs are aligned with 154 of the 169 targets of the SDGs. This is the first time that all NDCs have been mapped against the 169 targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, providing a significant resource for policy-makers looking to understand how to achieve the goals of both agendas. The greatest alignment is in the energy, forest, land use and agriculture sectors, but opportunities were found across all 17 SDGs, including health, transport, and education.\nClimate Watch\'s emission scenarios tool initially contains emission trajectories for over 60 countries or regions. This resource can help policymakers and researchers determine the most economically advantageous ways to deliver their climate plans and collectively achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. In addition to national-level insights, users can use models on Climate Watch to explore temperature impacts of different emission trajectories. For example, one model shows that if current national targets under the Paris Agreement were achieved, they could limit warming to 2.8 degrees Celsius. This indicates that enhanced efforts are necessary to limit warming to below 2 degrees Celsius or 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nClimate Watch builds on the success of WRI\'s CAIT Climate Data Explorer which for many years has served as the definitive resource for credible and comparable country-level emissions data for governments, researchers, media outlets and others.\nThe platform is one of three tools the NDC Partnership has created to help countries achieve ambitious climate goals while enhancing sustainable development. The others include the NDC Funding & Initiatives Navigator, a searchable database of financial and technical assistance programs, and the NDC Toolbox Navigator, a database of tools, guidance, and advisory support to help countries implement their NDCs.\n"Climate science has long been guiding us toward the need for a zero-carbon future," said Saleem Van Groenou, Program Manager for Google Earth Outreach. "Businesses like ours have an important role to play in accelerating the transition to a clean energy economy. But rising to the global challenge involves a complex mix of policy, technology, and international cooperation. Climate Watch brings together the global information and tools to understand this challenge and catalyze action."\nFunding for this initiative is provided by the International Climate Initiative (IKI) of Germany\'s Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB), Google, the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment, and the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.\nContact: Rhys Gerholdt, senior communications manager, 202/729-7639, rgerholdt@wri.org; Andrea Risotto, communications manager, NDC partnership support unit, andrea.risotto@wri.org\nTeamManager-6057140 TeamManager\nRhys Gerholdt, senior communications manager, 202/729-7639, rgerholdt@wri.org; Andrea Risotto, communications manager, NDC partnership support unit, andrea.risotto@wri.org\n'b'Climate targets will be lost if emission reductions are delayed, Swiss climate scientist Thomas Stocker said on Thursday , while emphasizing the importance of sticking to the Paris Agreement temperature target. It seeks to ensure the increase in global average temperature is well below 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels.\nStocker is co-chair of the working group of one of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change and is head of climate and environmental physics, Physics Institute, University of Bern. He was in the city to deliver the Elev enth Jeremy Grantham Lecture on Climate Change after an initial round of climate change quiz for students at the IISc auditorium.\nEarlier, students battled it out at the annual climate change quiz for prizes ranging from Rs 4,000 to Rs 10,000."There are over 1300 students from engineering and science colleges," said M K Nagaraj, consultant technologist, Divecha Centre for Climate Change, IISc, the organizers. Global Academy of Technology won the first prize, Maharani\'s Science College for Women came second and St Joseph\'s College of Science got the third prize.\n'b'Publication: Michigan Daily, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor MI.\nAbout 70 people gathered Wednesday night in North Quad Residence Hall for the 2017 Climate Blue Spring Symposium, titled "With or Without US?" The symposium included a presentation of students\' findings from the22nd Conference of Parties, hosted by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Marrakech, Morocco, as well as an expert panel of environmental scientists and policymakers.\nClimate Blue is a group comprising University students and faculty, businesspeople, non-governmental professionals and public servants representing the Universitys delegation to the Conference of Parties.\nAcknowledging the Trump administration\'s failure to address climate change, many speakers at the event stressed the importance of strengthening local, state and international policy.\nEd Waisanen, a graduate student in the School of Natural Resources and Environment, took part in this year\'s delegation, and pointed out that though the United States is an important actor in the fight against climate change, it is not the only one.\n"Climate resilience has really become a part of international development efforts," he said. "Even if the U.S. isn\'t interested in that, it\'ll still continue to be the case internationally."\nPublic Policy senior Connor Rubin, a member of the delegation and a moderator for the event, said in addition to being a regional issue, climate change also cuts along generational lines. TheDivest and Invest Campaign, which encourages cutting business ties with organizations that are heavy polluters, is one place he said this was apparent in. In 2015, Central Student Government andsenate facultypassed resolutions encouraging the University to divest from fossil fuels.\n"The divest movement is alive and well in the United States," he said. "It certainly got a lot of attention at COP, but a lot less from older generations."\nFollowing the delegates\' presentation, the panel of environmental scientists and policymakers discussed the future of climate policy on the state and local levels. State Rep. Yousef Rabhi (DAnn Arbor) considered the issue of being a Democratic politician in a majority-Republican state, saying that compromise was possible and necessary.\n"Two months ago, I went to the Sportsmen\'s Caucus meeting," he said. "These are men and women who enjoy hunting and fishing; I\'ve never touched a gun. I wanted to reach out to this group of people to understand what their top issues were, and even though we disagreed on some very fundamental issues, I found that there were a lot of issues we agreed on. They are strong conservationists. They want biodiversity because they want to hunt that biodiversity; I want it because I think it\'s inherently right. So while we might have slightly different end goals, we essentially want the same thing."\nSeveral members of the panel expressed the sentiment that states and cities would now pick up the slack left by the federal government on climate change. Missy Stults, a research fellow at the Graham Sustainability Institute, pointed out, however, that the absence of the federal government makes lower jurisdictions responsibilities more difficult to carry out.\n"Cities have been leaders in climate action in our nation, long before Obama took office," she said. "We know that\'s true, in large part because the effects of climate change are felt mostly at the local level. Regardless if you\'re a Republican or Democrat, a disaster is a disaster. That said, after the election we took a little step back  there is no federal money for climate programs anymore."\nMark Barteau, the director of the University Energy Institute, said that while there are ways that smaller locales could lead on climate change, they are often held back by larger institutions.\n"You promise not to tweet this?" he said to laughter from the audience. "I have the dubious honor of holding the DTE energy chair. We are reliant on DTE. Their energy supply is generated 75 percent from coal. Ann Arbor has similar issues. What\'s limiting both of them is the limitation of energy choice in state legislation. As they replace coal plants, our carbon footprint will go down, because our purchased electricity will go down. But we can\'t cut that because of state law."\nIn his closing remarks, Rabhi emphasized the importance of coalition building in fighting climate change, saying the economic issues raised by addressing climate change can\'t be ignored.\n"I don\'t think we will be able to make meaningful progress until we find work for coal miners in West Virginia, autoworkers in Detroit," he said. "We can\'t make progress if we don\'t get out and support those workers. And that\'s not only providing them an economic future, but being there for them when they need us, and letting them know that the environmental community is with them."\nCredit: Andrew Hiyama\n'b"Publication: Arkansas Traveler, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville AR.\nThe mayor of Fayetteville signed a statement June 1 addressed to President Donald Trump and helped draft a letter to the United Nations that addresses Trumps decision to officially withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, said the Fayetteville sustainability department director.\nThe goal is to help the rest of the world realize that Trump speaks for his administration and the executive branch, but he doesnt necessarily speak for all Americans, said Peter Nierengarten, Fayettevilles sustainability department director.\nMayor of Fayetteville Lioneld Jordan was one of 68 mayors that signed a statement through the Mayors National Climate Action Agenda, according to the official statement. Mayors across the U.S. signed the statement, committing to uphold the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.\nEach mayors respective city will continue to increase investments toward renewable energy and will work to avoid worldwide climate risks, according to the statement.\nThe City Council of Fayetteville previously approved Resolution No. 45-17 on Feb. 17, according to the Fayetteville city website. The resolution expressed the council's support for the creation of an Energy Action Plan in 2017. The goal of the plan is to increase energy efficiency, increase the supply of renewable energy, increase efforts for fuel efficiency and improve solid waste reduction.\nThe MNCAA calls for the development of regular community-wide reports and inventory of greenhouse gases, according to the MNCAA website. The MNCAA also calls for creating plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions long- and short-term.\nJordan also signed a separate letter to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Nierengarten said. The letter calls for a partnership between the leaders of cities and states across the U.S. to continue their support for the Paris Climate Agreement.\nThe goal of the Paris Climate Agreement is to have a collaborative effort to keep the global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius, according to the UNFCCC website. Those within the agreement have to regularly report their emissions and the efforts they are putting forth to reach the goal of the agreement.\nThe date for the letter to be sent has not been confirmed.\nEven though Trump withdrew the U.S. from the agreement, there are still people who want to achieve the goals of this agreement even without federal leadership, Nierengarten said.\nThe letter to the UNFCCC, composed by various mayors, governors, university and college leaders and businesses, reiterates the unified effort to continue supporting the Paris Climate Agreement, according to the official letter.\nThe statement and letter were written in anticipation of the presidents decision, Nierengarten said.\nCredit: Jay Peterson\n"b'World Wildlife Fund issued the following news release:\nThe Green Climate Fund (GCF) and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) today formalized an agreement uniting the two organizations in efforts to develop and oversee large-scale climate adaptation and mitigation projects across the globe.\n"As an implementation partner of the Green Climate Fund, WWF is pleased to help countries bring forward projects to the GCF that will help them meet their climate action priorities," said David McCauley, WWF senior vice president for policy and government affairs. "Climate change is a complex, global challenge that requires bold actions backed by financing at scale. Our partnership can help accelerate these investments."\nAs an Accredited Entity of the Green Climate Fund, WWF can serve as a partner to developing countries seeking GCF support, able to manage GCF funding of up to $250 million per program or project.\n"WWF works in more than 100 nations around the world, and climate change affects every one of them," said McCauley. "We know that developing nations need more financial support to accelerate implementation of their Nationally Determined Commitments under the Paris Agreement. WWF can catalyze the types of coalitions needed to meet this challenge -- especially through forest carbon conservation and capitalizing on the climate resiliency benefits of healthy ecosystems such as watersheds, wetlands and coral reefs."\nThe GCF has approved a $26.6 million investment in the Bhutan for Life project, brought forward by WWF on behalf of the Royal Government of Bhutan to help protect half of the country\'s territory for climate, biodiversity and other benefits. Bhutan is the only country to commit to remaining carbon-neutral, depending on its forests to absorb more carbon than the country emits each year. To maintain and wisely manage the country\'s protected areas, the government and WWF are establishing a $43 million fund that will be drawn down over a 14-year period as the government gradually increases its management capacities and funding -- committing $75 million over the project\'s life -- to become fully sustainable.\nThe Green Climate Fund is a multilateral fund created to help developing nations address the causes and consequences of climate change. Established under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) in 2010, the GCF supports a wide range of programs and projects around the world.\nThis document was posted showing the date: Nov. 16, 2017.\nContact: Chris Conner, 202/495-4786, christopher.conner@wwfus.org\nMSTRUCK-6079847 MSTRUCK\nChris Conner, 202/495-4786, christopher.conner@wwfus.org\n'b'Conservation International issued the following news release:\nConservation International joins leaders across the climate movement at COP 23, the annual United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in Bonn, Germany, November 6 - 17. Participating nations will meet to advance the goals of the Paris Agreement and achieve progress on its implementation guidelines. The negotiation session is hosted by the Government of Fiji, the first time a Pacific Island country has led these negotiations.\nNature-based solutions to climate change are essential strategies for meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. These climate solutions include: reducing deforestation, oceans and island-scale resilience, tropical reforestation, mangrove restoration, ecosystem-based adaptation, coastal carbon management, and climate-resilient agriculture, aquaculture and fisheries. In anticipation of negotiations at COP 23, Conservation International calls on countries to: expand use of nature-based solutions in national climate action, include natural climate solutions as part of market-based mechanisms, and Incorporate the traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples in climate decisions and actions.\nConservation International\'s oceans work will take center stage at several side events throughout the conference, highlighting key successes in the Pacific, a nod to the host of this year\'s negotiations. Conservation International will also highlight strategic collaborations with countries and non-state actors on protecting ocean health and coastal ecosystems through conservation and sustainable management.\n"Fiji and other Pacific Island nations are sharing here at COP23 the stark reality affecting indigenous people living off or near oceans today," said Shyla Raghav, Climate Lead, Conservation International. "Sea level rise, ocean acidification among others are shifting the Pacific Islands\' way of life. Conservation International has been active in collaboration with Fiji, the Cook Islands, Samoa and other island nations on adapting to climate change impacts.

CGP Grey, CC BY\nThe evidence is incontrovertible. Global warming is occurring. Climate change is real, is serious and has been influenced by anthropogenic activity. The scientific evidence is clear: Global climate change caused by human activities is occurring now, and is a growing threat to society.\nAs these scientific societies position statements reflect, there is a clear scientific consensus on the reality of climate change. But although public acceptance of climate theory is improving, many of our elected leaders still express skepticism about the science. The theory of evolution also shows a mismatch: Whereas there is virtually universal agreement among scientists about the validity of the theory, only 33 percent of the public accepts it in full. For both climate change and evolution, skeptics sometimes sow doubt by saying that it is just a theory.\nHow does a scientific theory gain widespread acceptance in the scientific community? Why should the public and elected officials be expected to accept something that is only a theory? And how can we know if the science behind a particular theory is settled, anyway?\nIn science, there are successful theories and unsuccessful theories. The word theory has nothing to do with the validity of a scientific principle or lack thereof. In contrast to general parlance where a theory is a proposed explanation whose status is still conjectural, a scientific theory is only conjectural until it is tested experimentally.\nThe issue is not whether a scientific theory is settled, but rather whether it works. Any successful scientific theory must be predictive and falsifiable; that is, it must successfully predict outcomes of controlled experiments or observations, and it must survive tests that could disprove the theory.\nA scientist advocating a particular theory must propose an experiment and use her theory to predict the results of that experiment. If the experimental results are inconsistent with her predictions, then she must admit that her theory is wrong. To gain acceptance for a theory, a scientist must be willing to subject it to a falsifiable test.\nIf an experiment produces results that are consistent with a scientists predictions, then thats good news for her theory. Just one successful test, though, is not usually enough. And the more controversial a theory is, the more experimental verification is required. As Carl Sagan said, Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\nWide acceptance comes from repeated, different experiments by different research groups. There is no threshold or tipping point at which a theory becomes settled. And there is never 100 percent certainty. However, near-unanimous acceptance by the scientific community simply doesnt occur unless the evidence is overwhelming.\nAs an example, in 1905, Albert Einstein published two papers on what we now call the Special Theory of Relativity. In these papers, he made a series of arguments that dramatically altered our notions of how the universe works. He argued that different observers measure the passage of time differently; they also measure different lengths for moving objects. He also showed that matter and energy are different forms of the same thing and theoretically can be converted into each other.\nBut Einstein didnt just make these statements. His theory made detailed, quantitative and falsifiable predictions that could be tested experimentally. Einstein was prepared to drop the entire theory if even one experiment convincingly contradicted his predictions. It took a long time for many of these predictions to be tested. In fact, the first direct measurements of gravity waves  one of Einsteins predictions  came just last year.\nEvery single confirmed experimental test of relativity has agreed (eventually) with Einsteins predictions. And relativistic theory has also been used as the basis for several technological advances, including GPS satellites, nuclear power and (unfortunately) nuclear bombs. There is absolutely no doubt among anyone in the physics community about the validity of the Theory of Relativity.\nFor an example of an unsuccessful theory, consider the announcement in March 1989 of a mechanism for nuclear fusion in a table-top configuration. This discovery of cold fusion was met with tremendous excitement since cost-effective nuclear fusion could hold the key to societys future power needs. But follow-up experiments by other scientific groups had results that disagreed with the cold fusion theory. Despite the initial excitement, there was near-unanimous consensus in the scientific community by the end of 1989 that the cold fusion theory was incorrect. When the evidence isnt there, the theory wont hold up.\nLike relativity, the Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection has been tested extensively. The body of experimental data that supports evolution is overwhelming. Of course, the fossil record supporting evolution is impressive and complete. But evolution has also been tested in real time with populations of organisms that can mutate and evolve over measurable time scales.\nEvolution has been subjected to many falsifiable tests and has emerged unscathed in every one. Yes, evolution is a theory  it is a theory that works and works very well, an overwhelmingly successful and correct theory.\nTheories of climate change are also supported by an extensive body of evidence. Of course theres the continuing upward drift of global average temperatures over the past few decades. But climate change models are also supported by numerous laboratory experiments that have provided compelling verification of the mechanisms by which carbon dioxide gas traps heat in our planets atmosphere.\nAnd, crucially, theories of global warming have passed falsifiability tests. Quantitative predictions of global warming were first made in the 1970s. Had there not been a clear increase in average global temperatures since then, climate scientists would have been forced to admit that climate change theory was wrong. In fact, several scientists in the 1960s who had predicted global cooling later had to admit that their theory was incorrect. Even a supposed pause in the increases in the 2000s (which were exaggerated by a spike in the average global temperature in 1998) has been followed by a strong upward trend during the past three years.\nTellingly, skeptics of both evolution and climate change theory have been unwilling or unable to subject their arguments to the same rigorous testing undergone by the very theories theyre criticizing. To make a scientific argument, critics must propose an experiment or measurement that can distinguish their alternative theory from evolutionary and climate change theories, and they must make a specific prediction for its outcome. And, like the scientists theyre criticizing, they must be willing to admit they are wrong if the results disagree with their prediction. Absent any falsifiable tests, why should the public or our elected officials believe their counterarguments?\nThese issues are important from more than just a purely scientific perspective. An understanding of evolution is critical for developing any valid strategy for combating the spread of diseases, especially since microbes responsible for diseases can mutate so rapidly. And an understanding and acceptance of climate change theory is critical if we are to take the necessary steps to avoid potential catastrophe from a continuation of the global warming trend.\nScientific theories arent mere conjecture. They are subject to exhaustive, falsifiable tests. Some theories fail these tests and are jettisoned. But many theories are successful in the face of these tests. It is these theories  the ones that work  that achieve consensus in the scientific community.\nTom Solomon receives funding from the National Science Foundation..\nCredit: Tom Solomon, Professor of Physics and Astronomy, Bucknell University\n"b'James Rowen, a longtime Wisconsin journalist and environmental blogger, recently discovered a stark remaking of a state Department of Natural Resources webpage on climate change and the Great Lakes.\nUntil December, the page, dating from the Democratic administration of former Gov. James Doyle, had this headline - Climate Change and Wisconsins Great Lakes - and a clear description of the state of the science, including this line reflecting the latest federal and international research assessments: Earths climate is changing. Human activities that increase heat-trapping (green house) gases are the main cause.\nThe page described a variety of possible impacts on the lakes and concluded, The good news is that we can all work to slow climate change and lessen its effects. Nine hyperlinks led readers to other resources.\nWhile the web address still includes /greatlakes/climatechange, the page, managed under agency appointees of Republican Gov. Scott Walker, now has this headline: The Great Lakes and a changing world. It now says this:\nAs it has done throughout the centuries, the earth is going through a change. The reasons for this change at this particular time in the earths long history are being debated and researched by academic entities outside the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. The effects of such a change are also being debated but whatever the causes and effects, the DNRs responsibility is to manage our states natural resources through whatever event presents itself.\nThere are now just two hyperlinks, one of which goes to a University of Wisconsin website about the environment and climate in the Yahara River watershed, which is not even connected to the Great Lakes. The other goes to the main page of the Center for Climatic Research at the University of Wisconsin. One has to poke around a while to get back to the issue at hand - the impact of global warming on the Great Lakes.\nJames Dick, a spokesman for the Department of Natural Resources, sent a response explaining the changes on the webpage, asserting that the page does not say the cause and effects of the change in climate are debatable.\nIt says they are being debated. Theres a difference, Dick said. Many scientists may be in agreement but this topic is still the subject of much debate and discussion among the general public.\nThis webpage, managed by Wisconsins Department of Natural Resources, describes the impact of climate on the Great Lakes. Between Oct. 30, 2016 (top), and Jan. 4, 2017, it was changed to reflect that the effects of climate change are being debated. (Jillian Kumagai for ProPublica)\nIts not unusual for elected state or national leaders to filter or shape government sources of information on contentious topics, including climate change, to suit their particular policy goals. Climate scientists decried such efforts through much of the presidency of George W. Bush, particularly when handwritten edits of government climate reports by political appointees were leaked in 2005.\nUnder President Obama, websites highlight points that supported his carbon-cutting plans, while findings that might point to different policies tended to stay deep in the body of reports.\nOne example is the treatment of hurricanes in the 2014 National Climate Assessment. The prominent text blurb of the report home page is, The intensity, frequency, and duration of North Atlantic hurricanes, as well as the frequency of the strongest hurricanes, have all increased since the early 1980s. Hurricane intensity and rainfall are projected to increase as the climate continues to warm.\nBuried in the report, theres this line, which seems to qualify the actual threats previously highlighted: [F]ewer storms have been observed to strike land during warmer years even though overall activity is higher than average, which may help to explain the lack of any clear trend in landfall frequency along the U.S. eastern and Gulf coasts.\nAnd so its entirely likely that the recent web revisions in Wisconsin portend whats to come in Washington, given how Walkers approach to climate change and industry resonates with that of many people in President-elect Donald Trumps circle of advisers.\nIn a phone interview, the Wisconsin blogger Rowen said he certainly suspects that his states experience is a troubling template for what could happen now at the federal level. If you have one-party control over all units of government and that party has a pro-corporate, anti-environment mindset, everything will be coordinated, whether in law, executive action or judicial review, he said.\nParties on all sides of the climate policy debate are now watching closely to see what happens to a vast array of webpages on climate change created during the Obama administration as Trumps fossil-fuel friendly Cabinet choices and environmental team get to work.\nEarly signs, including a 74-question survey sent to Department of Energy employees (which the Trump transition team quickly disavowed as unsanctioned), had environmentalists and scientists deeply worried.\nSome scurried to set up independent archives for potentially vulnerable climate data, with a repository established by the Technoscience Research Unit at the University of Toronto.\nWith Republicans in control in most states, and with the incoming White House and Congress committed to undoing President Obamas climate policies, the uncertainty theme around climate change appears likely to become popular.\nTo be sure, enduring uncertainty does surround many of the most consequential aspects of global warming, like the speed of sea-level rise and extent of warming in this century. But for decades risk experts and economists with a varied range of political views have agreed that uncertain, but momentous outcomes are the reason to act - not a reason to delay.\nAnd the data continue to accrue, with 2016 now set to be the warmest on Earth since at least 1880, when thorough temperature record keeping began, and a new study finding that, if anything, warming has been underestimated in recent years because of imperfect analysis of ocean data gathered by ships and buoys.\nLately, the wider climate-skeptic chorus has been dominated by Walker-style references to uncertainty or complexity in climate science, crystallized by phrases like Im not a scientist and the climate has always changed.\nWhen we wrote to Wisconsin officials seeking an explanation for the changes on the website, Dick, the natural resources department spokesman, sent the following email:\nAs we do from time to time with other website pages, we updated a webpage that had not been updated in several years. The update reflects our position on this topic which we have communicated for years - that our agency regularly must respond to a variety of environmental and human stressors from drought, flooding, and wind events to changing demographics.\nOur agency must be ready to respond to each of these challenges using the best science available to us. That is our role in this issue. Adaptation has been our position on this topic for some time. The recent update to one single webpage on our website was intended to reflect this perspective and approach to the topic.\nThe updated page does not deny climate is changing and it does not challenge the dedicated work of the scientists who are working on this issue. In fact, this updated page links to U.W.-Madison programs that include climate change in their research. It also does not say the cause and effects of the change in climate are debatable. It says they are being debated. Theres a difference. Many scientists may be in agreement but this topic is still the subject of much debate and discussion among the general public.\nThe last line raises a question about the role of government in helping explain to the public what many scientists agree on.\nOne thing that seems true is that so much information has accrued around climate change science and what it means for policy in recent years that partisans seeking to purge government websites have their work cut out for them.\nIf you search the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources website, for instance, for the phrase climate change there are still some hits, including an educational resource for kids titled, Global Warming is Hot Stuff!\nTheres still an article posted from the February 2011, issue of the magazine of the natural resources department, in which Jack Sullivan, then the director of the agencys Bureau of Science Services, said, We need to think about what climate change means for our natural resources and get out ahead of this problem, and were working hard to do that.\nSullivan, however, retired in 2015, when the agencys science budget was deeply cut under Walker and a Republican-dominated Legislature.\nCredit: Andrew Revkin\n'b'As the mayoral race heats up, so has the issue of climate change. \nIncumbent Mayor Rick Kriseman is using the global phenomenon to attack former Mayor Rick Baker. \nKriseman, a Democrat, signed a resolution with more than 300 other mayors to uphold the Paris agreement on climate change after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the accord on June 1. \nThe Kriseman campaign then assailed Baker, a Republican, for his silence over Trump\'s stance and actions on climate change. The incumbent mayor said local leaders must step up in the face of the federal retreat on climate issues - especially in a waterfront city, in a state already affected by climate change. \n"It sends an important message to the community," Kriseman said. "Mayors around the country recognize that as leaders of our community, we have to send a message about the importance of the issue. \n"Mayors are the elected officials closest to the people." \nBaker said he doesn\'t dispute that the climate is changing. But he said he\'s unsure of the role humans play in the warming of the earth and its consequences: the rise in sea levels and decline in ice sheets. \n"You can\'t look at the polar ice caps and not know that climate change is going on," Baker said. "Man has had an effect, the extent of that effect is up to great debate right now." \nRather than arguing about the origins of the crisis, Baker said, leaders should act. \n"No matter what you believe," he said, "the important thing is to reduce carbon in the atmosphere." \nYet Baker was dismissive of Kriseman\'s activism in signing the national mayor\'s petition. \n"Just sign a letter?" Baker said. "You haven\'t done anything." \n- - - \nKriseman begged to differ and pointed to his past acts. The mayor signed an executive order in late 2015 committing the city to operate totally on clean energy. He also launched a campaign to qualify St. Petersburg as a five-star community with a national sustainability organization. \nHe also rattled off a list of projects undertaken since he took office in 2014: Solar panels at parks; geothermal energy at North Shore Park; a bike share program; and a seagrass mitigation bank to boost preservation. \n"This is not an issue that, come election year, I\'ve come to the table on," Kriseman said. \nHis environmental credentials, however, suffered a serious blow last year: the city\'s sewer system was swamped by a tropical storm and a hurricane and released 200 million gallons of sewage since August 2015 - much of it into Tampa Bay. \nBaker touted his own environmental bonafides: A seat on two statewide commissions; the city\'s initial designation as a green city when he first served as mayor from 2001-10; undertaking the first efforts to make city buildings more energy efficient; and the cleanup of Lake Maggiore. \nSaid Baker: "We were very, very conscious of the environment in my administration." \nAs the Kriseman campaign starts criticizing Baker over climate change, so too is the former mayor fond of using the sewage crisis to batter Kriseman. \n"When you dump sewage into the bay, it\'s hard to maintain your green city status," Baker said. It is a line he has used repeatedly on the campaign trail. \nKriseman volleyed back with a familiar argument he\'s been making on the campaign trail: He said he inherited those leaky sewer pipes and aging system from his predecessors, including Baker. \n"I was the only mayor that has invested resources to make sure it doesn\'t happen again," Kriseman said. He has proposed a $304 million plan to fix the city\'s sewage system. \nHowever, that\'s also part of a pending consent order with the state Department of Environmental Protection compelling the city to fix its sewer woes. There\'s also an ongoing state criminal inquiry into the city\'s sewage problems. \n- - - \nThe mayoral contest is a nonpartisan race. But the politics of climate change has become a partisan issue in local elections, said Edward A. Parson, an environmental law professor at UCLA and co-author of The Science and Politics of Global Climate Change. That trend has only accelerated since Trump\'s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord. \nBaker is hardly the only politician to claim that there\'s still a scientific debate about the causes of climate change, Parson said. So do most Republicans. \nParson was blunt: "That\'s a crock of hogwash." \nThe science on humans\' role in climate change is settled, he said. \nBut the professor said Baker\'s belief that government leaders need to reduce the release of carbon into the atmosphere is a break from Republican ideology. \nThe GOP usually justifies the party\'s uncertainty on climate change as a reason not to curb carbon emissions, Parson said. But scientists agree that man-made carbon dioxide is adding to the "greenhouse effect" that traps heat radiating from the Earth, warming the planet. \nKriseman, however, has also used climate change to defend his record. \nThe mayor has framed the massive sewage spills during his tenure partially as a consequence of a changing climate. But by attributing individual weather events - 2016\'s Hurricane Hermine helped flood the city\'s sewer system - to climate change, Parson said the mayor is guessing at a phenomenon that scientists are still studying. \n"What (Kriseman) is saying might be true," Parson said, "but the act of attributing a single event to a big trend is actually very difficult." \nParson said it was akin to trying to figure out if a single home run hit by baseball great Barry Bonds can be attributed to Bonds\' admitted use of steroids. But Bonds also hit home runs before he started taking performance-enhancing drugs. \n- - - \nIn the end, Parson said, local leaders need to be heard on climate change. But he admitted that their ability to mitigate its effects is extremely limited. \n"It\'s a shame, local government has to be a partner in adaptation," he said, "but local government is not the sensible or ideal place to reduce emissions." \n"It\'s not St. Petersburg\'s emissions that is changing St. Petersburg\'s climate. It\'s a huge global problem that\'s changed everyone\'s climate." \nTimes senior news researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report. Contact Charlie Frago at cfrago@tampabay.com or (727)893-8459.

Besides its nonsensical objective of limiting \'Earth\'s temperature\' rise as if we had a global thermostat, the agreement lets developing countries largely off the hook. This despite the fact that non-OECD countries are now the greatest source of energy related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. \nFor example, while the U.S. agreed to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (82 per cent of which is CO2) by 26-28 per cent below its 2005 level by 2025, China committed to stop increasing its CO2 emissions by 2030. Hanna Fekete, a founding partner of the Germany-based NewClimate Institute, explained, "Taking into account implemented policies, along with expected economic growth and other factors, China\'s GHG emissions in 2025 will be 70 per cent above 2005 levels. This is putting them on track to meeting their Paris Agreement target." \nAnd it will not be necessary for developing nations to meet their Paris emission goals anyway. They have an out-clause, one not applicable to developed countries. \nArticle 4 in the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the treaty underlying Paris, states: \n"Economic and social development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of the developing country Parties." \nActions that significantly reduce CO2 emissions would usually entail dramatically cutting back on the use of coal [Eth] the source of most of the developing world\'s electricity. As coal is generally the least expensive source of power, reducing CO2 output by restricting coal use would undoubtedly interfere with development priorities. \nSo, developing countries almost certainly won\'t do it, citing Article 4 of the UNFCCC as their excuse. \nUNFCCC supporters have speculated that the inclusion of a new phrase added to the agreements in 2014 [Eth] that countries\' responsibilities will be decided "in light of different national circumstances" [Eth] will impose tougher requirements on poor nations as they develop. \nThat is unlikely. Article 4 has been the foundation of all UN climate negotiations, and developing countries will not allow this to change. Chinese negotiator Su Wei made this clear when he explained his government\'s position that the purpose of the Paris Agreement is to "reinforce and enhance" the UNFCCC, not rewrite it. \nObama did his best to "Trump-proof" his climate change agenda, even giving $500 million to the UN Green Climate Fund just three days before he left office. Trump needs to "Democrat-proof" his agenda, and clearly, the best way to do that is to withdraw from the UNFCCC completely, which he can do without Senate approval. \nUnlike Paris, which stipulates that the earliest a country can be out of the agreement is November 2020, withdrawal from the UNFCCC is allowed with one year\'s notice. And once a signatory exits the UNFCCC, they are out of all agreements that are based on the UNFCCC. This includes Paris, the Green Climate Fund, and the 2013 "Warsaw international mechanism for loss and damage associated with climate change impacts" under which developed nations are held to a potential liability of trillions of dollars for the impact of extreme weather events that are supposedly our fault. \nTo keep his campaign promise to "stop all payments of the United States tax dollars to UN global warming programs," Trump could work to get out of, or disregard, each of the UNFCCC agreements one by one. But this would result in years of conflict for the new administration. It is far better to be done with the hugely expensive and unscientific UNFCCC climate fiasco once and for all. \nJoe Bast, president and CEO of The Heartland Institute, a national nonprofit research centre based in Arlington Heights, Illinois, summed up the situation well: "This really is a case where cutting the tail off the dog all at once, rather than an inch at a time, is the right move. It would be the shot heard around the world and bring the whole man-made global warming house of cards tumbling down." \nTom Harris is executive director of the Ottawa, Canada-based International Climate Science Coalition.\nCredit: Submitted Article\n'b'Publication: The Daily Cardinal, University of Wisconsin - Madison, Madison WI.\nClimate fiction: A novel describes New Yorkers keeping on even after 50 feet of sea-level rise next century. www.shutterstock.com\nEarths climate system is replete with potential surprises, and the climate science community tends to be conservative when projecting future changes. The world also suffers from a creative deficit in imagining the human response to climate change  a deficit that fiction is well-suited to help alleviate.\nOne focus of my research is on sea-level change, both in the past and in the future. In his new work of climate fiction, New York 2140, author Kim Stanley Robinson supposes that climate scientists like me will be surprised by how quickly the worlds ice sheets will shrink and sea levels will rise. His novel explores how civilization might nonetheless muddle through to remake this reshaped world.\nIn Robinsons future, the First Pulse of Antarctic and Greenland ice sheet collapse in the 2050s led to 10 feet of global sea-level rise in the course of a decade. The First Pulse and the food crisis of the 2070s served as focusing events, leading the world to take greenhouse gas reductions more seriously. Electricity generation shifted to renewables; container ships were replaced with fleets of wind-powered clippers; lighter-than-air airships replaced airplanes.\nYet these efforts were not enough to avoid a Second Pulse at the end of the 21st century, driven first by melting at the Aurora Basin in East Antarctica but then cascading around the worlds ice sheets, leading to a further 40 feet of sea-level rise.\nCurrent science suggests the speed of sea-level rise in Robinsons future is implausible. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change s 2013 report estimated that, under a future with high greenhouse gas emissions, global average sea level would likely rise by between about 1.5 and three feet over the course of this century. My research groups projections generally agree with the IPCCs assessment. But the IPCC assessed only what is likely; our groups work also suggests that sea-level rise as high as about eight feet by 2100 and 18 feet by 2150 is physically plausible, though extremely unlikely.\nBut theres a lot we dont know about the behavior of ice sheets, particularly those  like the West Antarctic and parts of the East Antarctic including the Aurora Basin  that sit on ground that is below sea level. For example, warm water can attack submarine ice from beneath. If the ground underneath the ice sheet is sloping the wrong way, deepening toward the continents interior, the waters advance will set up a self-sustaining cycle that exposes a growing cross-section of ice to erosion.\nIn addition, ice sheets can form unstable ice cliffs at their margins. A recent study that incorporated the collapse of ice cliffs found that, under a future of high emissions, it may be significantly easier to get to eight feet by 2100 and 18 feet by 2150 than previously thought. Still, even that study could not produce Robinsons 50 feet until after 2200.\nRobinsons novel, however, is not a scientific projection: It is an exploration of human resilience in the face of extreme pressure. There are four basic ways coastal communities can respond to sea-level rise: suffering damage, developing protective infrastructure, finding ways of accommodating flooding and retreating from the coast. Robinsons New Yorkers engage in all four  and Robinsons vision of accommodation is profoundly richer than in the imaginings of adaptation strategies developed by national, state and local governments.\nDespite the environmental apocalypse, life carries on in a flooded New York that has remade itself as a super-Venice. (See Climate Centrals Surging Seas maps to explore what Manhattan would look like with 10 meters (33 feet) or 20 meters (66 feet) of sea-level rise.) The submerged streets of Lower Manhattan have turned into canals, crisscrossed by pedestrian high lines. Vaporettos have replaced taxis. Skyscrapers whose bases have fallen beneath the waves are protected by nanodiamond coatings and powered by solar microgrids.\nRetreat has occurred mainly from the intertidal zone of Midtown Manhattan, where the forces of the daily tidal cycle wreak havoc on structural integrity. On the dry land surrounding the Cloisters, far uptown, carbon nanomaterials originally intended for space elevators allow new buildings on the shrunken island to reach hundreds of stories upward.\nTechnological progress focused on improving lives rather than accommodating the changed world has apparently slowed to a crawl  in some ways, not much has changed from today. Airships are steered by chatty but rule-bound AIs, and communications take place by tablet, with celebrities broadcasting live feeds of real-world adventures through the cloud.\nThough this slow pace of progress may be literary license taken to make the world more relatable, it may also be a fair projection: If environmental crises consume the worlds R&D budget, there may be little left for innovations without a survival benefit.\nMeanwhile, financial capitalism proceeds much as it did in the early 21st century, periodically growing and imploding bubbles and receiving government bailouts. As in most of Robinsons works, the limits of the capitalist system serve as a motif: The book culminates in a democratic-socialist fantasy of an alternative political response to a bursting financial bubble that seems more rooted in 2008 than 2140.\nIn the real world, when climate change first entered the mainstream of civic discourse in the late 1980s, policy discussion focused almost entirely on limiting greenhouse gas emissions. While the world has made some progress, reflected in the United Nations Paris Agreement and in the recent near-stability of global carbon dioxide emissions, the pace has been slow. The planet is increasingly feeling the effects of climate change, and so adapting to these effects has become a growing part of both scientific research and public discourse.\nBut most work on climate change adaptation has focused on near-term, marginal changes: for instance, making communities more resilient in the face of ever more common weather extremes, or installing pumps and elevating infrastructure to deal with the rapid growth of minor nuisance flooding along the shore.\nClimate change and sea-level projections usually end by 2100, and on that timescale, two to three feet of global sea-level rise is far more likely than Robinsons 50 feet. But the world will not end in 2100, and many of the public works built today will still be around a century from now. In New Jersey, for example, many of the electric grids switching stations that flooded in 2012 during Superstorm Sandy were sited more than a century earlier, during the age of Thomas Alva Edison.\nSo climate fiction can play a critical role in the face of the large-scale experiment we humans are conducting with the worlds climate system: inspiring creative rethinks of the designs and technologies needed to reshape how we relate to our environment.\nScience tells us that, by reshaping our global energy and agricultural systems, we can avoid the magnitude of planetary change that Robinson depicts. But to make those changes and to adapt to the changes we dont avoid, the worlds best minds need to focus, not on new apps or financial innovations, but on the civilizational challenges at hand.\nWorks like Robinsons  starkly beautiful and fundamentally optimistic visions of technological and social change in the face of some of the worst devastation we might bring upon ourselves  can inspire that focus in a way that myopic discussions of the near term or grim, apocalyptic tales cannot.\nRobert Kopp receives funding from the U.S. National Science Foundation, New Jersey Sea Grant, and Rhodium Group.

Instead, his April 22 remarks focused on well-understood issues such as "keeping our air and water clean, E preserving our forests, lakes, and open spaces, and E protecting endangered species." \nGlobal-warming activists and their allies in the press thrashed the president for his Earth Day release. Huffington Post called Trump\'s statement "shameful." The UK\'s The Independent noted that, in contrast to Trump, former Presidents George Bush and Barack Obama both addressed climate change in their Earth Day statements. AOL News pointed out that Obama\'s 2016 Earth Day statement mentioned climate change five times. \nIt surprised no one that Trump would ignore man-made global warming on Earth Day. He has made it clear that, while he promotes real pollution controls, he has no patience for the improbable hypothesis that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are causing dangerous climate change. \nBut what was surprising was that, even though Earth Day now concentrates strongly on climate change, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also made no direct reference to the issue in his 2017 Earth Day statement. Aside from embedding two climate change-related web links into his remarks, Trudeau said nothing at all about what he called "the great global challenge of our time" in his 2016 Earth Day statement.  Trudeau also joined Trump in promoting economic growth in his Earth Day statement, something bound to irk climate campaigners. Again, this was no surprise for Trump. But Trudeau\'s Earth Day support of actions to "grow the economy" coupled with a string of recent decisions [Eth] giving the green light to the Trans Mountain and the Line 3 pipeline projects, and his enthusiastic endorsement of the Keystone XL pipeline [Eth] suggests that the Canadian government is starting to see the hand writing on the wall: where the U.S. goes on climate and energy, so, eventually, must go Canada if we are to maintain a reasonable standard of living. \nThe reaction of climate campaigners to Trudeau\'s recent actions is revealing. Green Party leader Elizabeth May said that she was ready to go to prison to stop Trans Mountain. 350.org founder Bill McKibben called Trudeau a "stunning hypocrite" on global warming in his April 17 piece in the U.K.\'s The Guardian. McKibben wrote about Trudeau, "He\'s hard at work pushing for new pipelines through Canada and the U.S. to carry yet more oil out of Alberta\'s tar sands, which is one of the greatest climate disasters on the planet." \nTo be sure, the Trudeau government has made some colossally stupid climate change-related moves in their first year and a half [Eth] their plans to phase out most of our inexpensive coal-fired power plants by 2030, and the upcoming nationwide minimum price on emissions of the benign gas carbon dioxide, for example. \nBut let\'s give credit where it\'s due. Both Trudeau and Trump gave us welcomed Earth Day presents on April 22: official environment statements with no mention of the costly and misguided climate scare.

PeacockDEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY, \nUNIVERSITY OF LETHBRIDGELast week Hurricane Harvey dumped over 50 cubic kilometres of water on a sadly unprepared Houston. Since then, Irma has ravaged several islands and is plowing toward Florida, with Jose in her wake to administer the double-tap.  Meanwhile, over 1,000 people have died in southern Asia from flooding, while here in Alberta we swelter in stifling smoke and heat.  Are these events caused by global warming? Or are they just weather? After all, droughts, floods, storms and fires have been coming and going for a very long time. Climate scientists such as Michael Mann (in a recent op-ed in the Guardian) have been careful to explain that one cannot attribute any particular event (such as a wildfire or a storm) to climate change. The immediate causes of storms, droughts and floods are complex and often subject to rapid, unpredictable fluctuations.However (and a big however), there is very good reason to think that the intensity and in some cases the frequency of such events are being increased by the global warming that the planet has already experienced, now more than one degree C (1.8 degree F) over pre-industrial times. Despite the complexity of climate the basic reason for this is simple: there is more heat than there used to be in the atmosphere and oceans and all that heat has to go somewhere. And go it will, whether or not there are people with their vulnerable infrastructures in the way.  But when so many people are suffering, is it even polite to "play politics" by bringing up global warming at a time like this? This question rests on a deep misunderstanding of the nature of climate science, and indeed all science. Because the science of climate has policy implications, some of which are very obvious (such as that humanity must abandon the use of fossil fuels as soon as possible), people make the mistake of thinking that climate science is a political position. They think that it is advanced mainly or entirely for rhetorical reasons. Even some academics who should know better make this mistake. Scientists are human; they are fallible and they have their loyalties and prejudices, their hopes and fears, like anyone else. However, they are also professionals. This means that they are trained, in simple terms, to tell the truth, to report what they have discovered even if it is disconcerting, inconvenient, unpopular or frightening. Some scientists are reluctant to discuss the policy implications of their work. Others (such as Professor Mann) are willing to speak out, often in the face of personal vilification. But when they report their scientific results they are simply doing their best (within the limits of human fallibility) to tell it like it is.  The visionary physicist David Bohm argued that science itself is a form of perception. Human sensation can be extended and made more acute by technology. We can use telescopes, satellites, deep-sea buoys, computers, ground-penetrating radar and a myriad other means to see what cannot be seen with the naked eye. Science is also a social institution with a long history. The scientific consensus that global warming is real and that it is caused almost entirely by human emissions of carbon dioxide is not a wild speculation by a few mavericks desperate to garner research grants or publicity. It has been built up on the basis of patient observations, calculations and cross-checks performed by thousands of scientists over many decades. It is not a political position, but just a perception. Could the perceived consensus be wrong? Of course! But are we willing to bet the whole farm on that slim chance? How lucky do we feel today?  The Great Leader in the White House recently proposed to cut $1 billion from the budget of the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), the U.S. agency whose job it is (among other things) to monitor climate and weather. The U.S. Senate, in a rare moment of clarity, refused to implement most of Mr. Trump\'s cuts. Even they seem to realize that at a time like this, we need science more than ever. We need science not only to report on and predict ecological disasters as they unfold, but to help humanity find its way out of the jam we have gotten ourselves into. To ignore the perceptions of our scientists at a time like this would be like trying to drive in heavy traffic with our eyes closed. This is not recommended.   And what are the implications for Alberta? That is a discussion for another time. I will merely note that we now have a government in power that says that it will make its decisions about climate and energy policy on the basis of science. Let\'s hold them to it.\nCredit: Submitted Article\n'b'U.S. climate report leaves little room for doubt \nE \nBy David Suzuki \nIt seems odd that a major U.S. government climate report released Nov. 3 didn\'t receive more media attention. \nBut then, the main thing newsworthy about the Climate Science Special Report is that it was released at all, apparently without political interference. \nAlthough the U.S. government is required by law - enacted by president George H.W. Bush in 1989 - to report to the public about "climate change and its physical impacts" every four years, the current administration is openly hostile to climate science and scientists. \nAccording to White House sources quoted in the New York Times, President Donald Trump was "barely aware of the report\'s existence." \nThe report, released by 13 federal agencies under the direction of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, examines the available science. It was written by dozens of government and non-government scientists, reviewed by the independent National Academy of Sciences and approved by the National Economic Council. \nIt concludes we are living in the warmest period in the history of modern civilization, with the last three years being the warmest on record, that we are seeing more "record-breaking, climate-related weather extremes" and that all the evidence points to human activities, "especially emissions of greenhouse gases," as the main cause. Climate change should be in the headlines every day until everyone takes it seriously, but the report\'s conclusions are not new. \n"Thousands of studies conducted by researchers around the world have documented changes in surface, atmospheric, and oceanic temperatures; melting glaciers; diminishing snow cover; shrinking sea ice; rising sea levels; ocean acidification; and increasing atmospheric water vapour," the reports says. \nIt\'s hard to imagine anyone could read this report, or read about it, and not be convinced we have an urgent problem and that failing to put everything we can into resolving it puts our survival at risk. \nAnd yet, the government overseeing this report is filled with people who reject climate science. \nThe president himself has called it a hoax. He\'s appointed climate science deniers to key positions, repealed and weakened environmental laws, had climate change references removed from the Environmental Protection Agency\'s website and barred EPA scientists from presenting climate change reports. \nMany delegates at the UN Climate Conference underway in Bonn, Germany, have condemned Trump\'s decision to pull the U.S. from the Paris Agreement. \nThe official White House statement on the report was a rehash of tired climate science-denial talking points. White House spokesperson Raj Shah said, "The climate has changed and is always changing." \nHe then went on to cast doubt regarding the climate\'s sensitivity to greenhouse gas emissions. \nEPA administrator Scott Pruitt has denied the well-known connection between carbon dioxide emissions and global warming, and Energy Secretary Rick Perry has argued the science isn\'t conclusive. \nBut the report also shows that, despite its apparent descent into a post-truth, anti-science dystopia, the United States still maintains sanity in some of its major institutions. \nOrganizations like NASA, NOAA, the EPA and the Department of Defense, along with numerous non-governmental scientific institutions, are continuing to examine the real trends and risks of a planet warming rapidly because of human activity. \nIt also shows we must do all we can to work toward solutions - economic, technological, philosophical and more - and to only support politicians who demonstrate the foresight, imagination and courage to take on this crisis with the force and intensity it merits. \nOne frustration of studying and communicating about climate issues is knowing that so many solutions exist and are being developed, but that widespread denial of the problem prevents us from moving beyond outdated technologies and economic systems. \nThat people who profit from those outdated technologies would do everything they can to sow doubt and confusion is not surprising. \nThat a government elected to serve the people would reject the findings of its own scientists and researchers from around the world to the detriment of human health, the economy and the environment is an intergenerational crime. \nChristopher Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, told the New York Times, "This profoundly affects our ability to be leaders in developing new technologies and understanding how to build successful communities and businesses in the 21st century." \nIt also puts human survival at risk. \nE \nDavid Suzuki is a scientist, broadcaster and author.\n'b'Study finds public misled from withheld climate knowledge \nBy David Suzuki \nCoal, oil and gas are tremendous resources: solar energy absorbed by plants and super-concentrated over millions of years. They\'re potent fuels and provide ingredients for valuable products. \nBut the oil boom, spurred  by improved drilling technology, came at the wrong time. \nProfits were and still are the priority - rather than finding the best, most efficient uses for finite resources. \nIn North America, governments and corporations facilitated infrastructure to get people to use oil and gas as if they were limitless. Companies like Ford built cars bigger than necessary, and although early models ran on ethanol, the oil boom made petroleum the fuel of choice. Public transit systems were removed and governments used tax revenues to accommodate private automobiles rather than buses and trains. \nThe oil industry fulfilled many of its promises and became the main driver of western economies. \nIt increased mobility and led to job and profit growth in vehicle manufacturing, oil and gas, tourism and fast food, among others. Petroleum-derived plastics made life more convenient. \nThe industry boom and the car culture it fuelled had negative consequences, though - including injuries and death, rapid resource exploitation, pollution and climate change. Plastics are choking oceans and land. \nAre these unintended consequences? \nWhen did people learn burning large quantities of fossil fuels might be doing more harm than good? Evidence suggests scientists, governments and industry knew all along there would be a steep price to pay for our excesses. \nIn the late 1800s, Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius warned that burning fossil fuels and increasing carbon dioxide emissions would initiate feedback loops and increase water vapour in the atmosphere, causing global temperatures to rise. \nScientific evidence for human-caused global warming has since increased to the point of certainty, but while few would dispute that burning coal, oil and gas causes pollution and public health problems, many still believe the role of fossil fuels in climate change is contentious. \nThere\'s a reason for that: According to volumes of research by journalists, investigators and academics - including a new peer-reviewed study - some of industry\'s largest players have long been deceiving the public about climate science. \nThe new study, by Harvard\'s Geoffrey Supran and Naomi Oreskes and published in Environmental Research Letters, analyzes 40 years of research and communications by Exxon Mobil. \n"Our findings are clear: Exxon Mobil misled the public about the state of climate science and its implications," Oreskes and Supran write in a New York Times opinion article. \n"Available documents show a systematic, quantifiable discrepancy between what Exxon Mobil\'s scientists and executives discussed about climate change in private and in academic circles, and what it presented to the general public." \nTaking up Exxon\'s challenge to "Read all of these documents and make up your own mind," the researchers examined the company\'s scientific research, internal memos and paid public-facing "advertorials." \nThey concluded that, although the company knew of and communicated internally about its product\'s climate impacts and the danger of it becoming a "stranded asset," it told the public a different story. \nExxon placed paid opinion articles in the New York Times between 1989 and 2004, at a cost of US$31,000 each. Contrary to the company\'s own research and internal communications - as well as overwhelming scientific evidence from around the world - the articles argued, among other things, that, "The science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil," and, "We still don\'t know what role man-made greenhouse gases might play in warming the planet." \nOreskes and Supran also note Exxon is being sued by current and former employees and investigated by the New York and MassachusettsEattorneys general and the federal Securities and Exchange Commission. \nMuch relates to whether the company "misled consumers, shareholders or the public about the environmental or business risks of climate change, or about the risk that oil and gas reserves might become stranded assets that won\'t be developed, affecting shareholder value." \nGiven climate change\'s serious implications, the fact that fossil fuel companies, aided by compromised governments and shady "think tanks" and media outlets, would put fossil fuel profits ahead of human health and survival is an intergenerational crime against humanity. We should commend Oreskes and others for their tireless efforts to bring this truth to light. \nDavid Suzuki is a scientist, broadcaster and author.\n'b'Publication: The Wesleyan Argus, Wesleyan University, Middletown CT.\nLike other forms of rhetoric, verbal efforts to promote environmental sustainability are rooted in human nature. In a society that desperately needs to engage in more sustainable practices, environmentalists and activists must ask themselves how best to persuade the public to participate in practices that are environmentally beneficial, or at least less detrimental. It is a dilemma, like other dilemmas of public persuasion, that is rooted in the question: how do we get people to care?\nTraditionally, most climate rhetoric has centered around peoples sense of morality, justice, and ethics. While these arguments are fair and hold water, I believe there is another method of rhetoric that may receive a heightened degree of response: a human-centered one that appeals to a persons sense of selfishness and, to an extent, right to exist in a prolific world.\nI am not naturally a cynical person, but I do have one slightly disparaging (though nonetheless observable) belief: humans are innately selfish. Though selfishness is usually considered a negative trait, it is a universal one, whether that manifests in large ways or small. This is not to say that compassion and empathy do not exist; they do, to an enormous and powerful extent. However, Id like to note that selfishness, too, plays an equally, if not more, powerful role.\nThe rhetoric of climate change does too little to appeal to the sense of selfishness that is fundamental to humanity. Rather, climate and sustainability rhetoric appeals to a sense of goodwill or guilt, with phrases like Save the coral reefs! and Save the polar bears! being some of the first that come to mind when considering the reasons to combat climate change. These phrases, though of course rooted in truth and a need for action, present humans as the ones who must do the saving of other creatures, rather than a species also at risk. Likewise, the species to which they refer are very much removed from the lives of most ordinary people. How many of us have seen a polar bear in the wild, or frequented a dying coral reef?\nInstead, we must shift our vision from a need to swoop in and save other creatures to a need to also save ourselves. If, environmentally, we continue to move in the direction that we are currently heading, the earth will reach a tipping point, crossing a boundary from which we will not return in over the course of our species existence. Average temperatures will increase drastically, and the climate will shift to a degree that is nearly impossible to predict. But these changes have the potential to affect humans to a massive extent. Entire neighborhoods will be flooded and destroyed due to rising waters and increased storm intensity. Devastating hurricanes like the ones that have ripped through the East Coast will become more frequent and more intense. And this is just in the short term. In the long term, climate change has the potential to, in the most extreme case, wipe out the human race. Therefore, when we talk about the effects of climate change, when we say that we must save the planet, rather we should be saying save humanity. Not only because this style of rhetoric will motivate more people, but because the future of humanity is increasingly at risk, as we make our planet more and more unlivable for our species.\nOn a similar note, the attention to non-human animals that pervades climate rhetoric also diverts attention from the many communities of lower socioeconomic standing that have already beenseverely affected by climate events. A prime example is post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans, in which the poorer communities suffered greatly from flooding. And many places, including the predominantly Black neighborhood of the Ninth Ward, remain severely damaged and largely abandoned. And yet, a decade after Katrina, little attention is paid to this community, with much more diverted to endangered animals and, more simply, the non-human Earth.\nIn spite of what is previously written, I do not intend to argue that we should ignore the continued destruction of non-human habitats, or that we should divert attention from pressing concerns of environmental degradation affecting plants and animals more than humans. There are thousands of species much more at risk from the impacts of climate change and hundreds currently endangered or extinct due to human interference, like, of course, coral reefs and polar bears. Efforts to protect the environment for non-human plants and animals are incredibly important, incredibly necessary, and in many ways more so than anthropocentric concerns.\nWe should, rather, include ourselves in the mix of species at risk, recognize that humans are not exempt from the impacts of climate change. We are as much a part of, and dependent upon, this environment as any other species, as much as we try to distinguish ourselves as disconnected from nature. This acknowledgement of dependence ensures that within rhetoric of saving the environment, it is clear that we are not angelic beings swooping in to save nature, but simply making the necessary actions to save our home and ourselves.\nBut the largest reason behind the need to shift climate rhetoric from save the earth to save ourselves is this: the earth, as a living planet, is going to be okay. Despite the rhetoric, the planet will weather climate change as it has weathered massive fluctuations in climate in the past. While in this case, the reason behind the climate fluctuation is quite different, as it is caused singularly by one species, there will still be plants and animals that thrive in changing environmental conditions. The environment, while perhaps taking a very different form to the one we know today, will soldier on.\nThis planet has undergone five major mass extinctions in the past: The Ordovician-Silurian, the Late Devonian, the Permian, the Triassic-Jurassic, and the Cretaceous-Tertiary. The Permian Mass Extinction, also known as The Great Dying, marks the most extreme example. 250 million years ago, 96 percent of life on earth went extinct, potentially due to colossal climate change. All life on earth today is descended from that surviving fourpercent. It is a percentage almost impossible to compute, almost impossible to imagine that life persevered and ballooned into the diversity of species we have today. And yet here we are, billions of years after the origin of life on this planet, in an extraordinarily ecologically diverse world. Thanks to diverse genetic pools of many species, life will persevere even with rising temperatures and sea levels and increased storms, floods, and droughts. The environment, or some form of environment, will survive. It may not, however, include humans.\nCulturally, humanity is taken to be eternal, endless, excepted from the rules of nature and evolution under which other, far less advanced species operate. In other words, we fancy ourselves eternal, and the earth temporary. While in reality both are ephemeral, it is also true the earth will far outlast humanity, as will life. We are not, by a long shot, the most resilient species on this planet. While we are excellent at adapting, we are not excellent at surviving through massive floods and tsunamis, living in droughts and extreme heat.\nThus, we must make efforts to shift the language around climate change to one that throws humans in the mix, recognizing the need to save humanity as more pressing and more true than the need to save the planet. Not only must we see ourselves as very much immersed in and dependent upon this environment, but we must realize that our future as a species relies upon our ability to recognize that we are more vulnerable than we think.\nCredit: Emmy Hughes, Assistant News Editor\n'b'Waikato University researchers have begun a study that will canvas Kiwis on how New Zealand can prepare for climate change. Science reporter Jamie Morton talked to  Professors Debashish Munshi and Priya Kurian about the project.\nAre you worried that many New Zealanders still refuse to accept climate change?\nThe good news is that more and more Kiwis are accepting that human-induced climate change is real.\nThe research shows that perceptions are shifting - and what is more important is that there is scope to deepen and broaden that shift. Helping make that happen is the focus of our project.\nWe are concerned but not really surprised that there are still a significant number of people who don\'t accept climate change.\nFor many people, who are busy enough with more immediate commitments, climate change appears to be, at best, part of the background noise.\nThere is scientific consensus that climate change is happening and there is no time to lose in stepping up public engagement on preparing people to adapt to the impacts of climate change. Your project has a large cultural component and you note there\'s strong interest from Maori in climate action. How can cultural values drive greater awareness or action on climate change - and how can climate advocates such as yourself harness this?\nConflicting cultural perspectives on the meaning of climate change and competing understandings of the implications of climate change are challenges that deepen uncertainties in decision-making processes.\nWhen we use the word "culture", we don\'t necessarily equate it with "ethnicity".\nFor us, culture is an expression of certain values and meanings.\nOur project has a special emphasis on engaging with Maori to address potential impacts of climate change on tikanga as well as on people\'s relationships with land, food, and ways of life.\nIf we can incorporate culturally appropriate tools we believe it will facilitate a better uptake of science-based climate adaptation strategies by different groups.\nResearch has suggested some values have been involved in the rejection of climate science. So how can we promote climate awareness to people who seem to be opposed to the concept on a deep-seated ideological level? Are there some people who are never going to agree?\nLet\'s take the second part of your question first.\nYes, there are some people whose ideological beliefs mean that they are likely to remain climate deniers.\nSuch beliefs may include political conservatives as well as religious fundamentalists who may view the current state as reflecting god\'s will.\nA counter question may be to ask whether we need everyone to believe in anthropogenic climate change before we act as a society?\nWe don\'t think so.\nFirstly as the realities of climate change - for example, increased frequency of extreme weather events and sea level rise - are experienced by people, those most affected, irrespective of belief in anthropogenic climate change, are most likely to be open to the need for climate adaptation.\nSecondly, research from the US shows that there is a disconnect between climate change scepticism and climate mitigation behaviour, such as supporting the shift to renewable energies.\nIn other words, irrespective of beliefs, people may well support climate-friendly policies that also lead to jobs and economic security.\nFrequent storm surges are eroding our coastlines and flooding towns at the water\'s edge. Just this week, two metres of coastline disappeared at Haumoana Beach in Hawkes Bay as huge swells lashed beach-side homes and threatened access to Cape Kidnappers.\nUp and down the coasts of both the North and the South Islands, homes are at risk. Anything that happens on the coast will, of course, have a cascading effect elsewhere. These changes thus are beginning to reshape the narrative as climate change comes closer to home.\nFinally, why is it so crucial that Kiwis make themselves aware of climate change and begin preparing for its impacts?\nThere is a general awareness of how vulnerable the Pacific Islands are to climate change. Yet, there are many in New Zealand who don\'t seem to realise that this country, too, is a Pacific Island nation - actually a set of islands.\nBy the Ministry for the Environment\'s own reckoning, the country is moving headlong towards more episodes of flooding and higher average temperatures, both leading to infrastructure damage, stress on housing, and irreversible damage to biodiversity caused by the spread of pests and diseases.\nThis is not meant to create a dystopic vision.\nOn the contrary, this is a call to acknowledge that climate change is happening and for us to prepare to adapt to it through innovative and collective approaches so that we can leave an inhabitable land for future generations.\n'b"DENIED\nKellyanne Conway Scolds Chris Cuomo for Daring to Ask About Climate Change\nIn a contentious CNN interview, Conway went after Cuomo for bringing up climate change in connection to Hurricane Harvey.\nMatt Wilstein\n08.30.17 10:14 PM ET\nChris Cuomo and Kellyanne Conway have a history.\nThe pair, known for their marathon interviews on CNN, were at it again Wednesday night, spending more than 20 minutes going back and forth in a contentious segment that began with a discussion of how President Trump will try to avoid the same pitfalls that plagued the Obama administrations efforts to pass a relief bill after Superstorm Sandy.\nAdvertisement\nBut it was Cuomos seemingly innocuous comment about the role of climate change in 100-year storms like the one currently battering Texas that really infuriated Conway.\nOne of the themes that's coming out of this, and it's not a discussion just to have now, but certainly in the weeks and months as we move forward, is whether or not what happened in Harvey and why it's happening and why these storms happen open up a discussion about the role of climate change, Cuomo said, a bit tentatively. Is the president, is the administration, open to that conversation?\nWith a look of disgust on her face, Conway replied, Chris, we're trying to help the people whose lives are literally underwater, and you want to have a conversation about climate change? Rolling her eyes, she added, I mean, that is - Im not going to engage in that right now.\nWhen Cuomo said he assumed that meant the answer to his question was no, Conway said, No, I didn't say that, Chris, you don't need to put words in my mouth.\nThen why, he replied, did she berate him for even asking the question, making it seem as though he didnt care about the victims.\nRelated in Arts and Culture\nAnn Coulter Might Dump Emperor God Trump Over Bannon\nFox Guests Weep Over Morally Bankrupt Trump\nWhy Are So Many Trans Women of Color Being Killed in U.S.?\nIn turn, Conway said she was simply exposing the irony of the conversation and accused Cuomo of playing amateur climatologist while she said she would play professional helper of those in need.\nShe then added, I'm going to focus on them for the in the short-term, perhaps the long-term, because I literally see people, I see pregnant women, including on your channel, who are in need, who say they're shivering or their kids or hungry, perhaps in reference to the Houston mother whose confrontation with a CNN reporter went viral this week.\nGood, you should, Cuomo said. But it doesn't mean you do that to the exclusion to the question of why storms happen. At some point, that could be part of the conversation.\nGiven the fact that the president is reluctant to even admit that he believes climate change is real, Cuomo shouldnt hold his breath.\n"b'Brian O\'Neill: I don\'t know if I love the fact that President Trump is getting out of this Paris Climate Change Agreement for A) it is the right thing to do because we are getting fleeced financially for a bogus claim or B) because it is driving the Never-Trumpers absolutely bonkers.\nJ Michael Malloy: Galileo was imprisoned because "the majority of scientists" believed he was wrong about the sun being the center of the universe. Remember with medical science thought that bleeding was an accepted form of treatment? Remember when saccharin was branded as unsafe for humans? I don\'t believe that "science" is always right.\nRichard Bombardier: 30 years ago these same scientists stated that the eastern seaboard would be under water by now due to global warming. Have you noticed the polar ice caps are larger now?\nChris Halpin Sr.: Galileo was not denied by scientists, but by traditional religious right that didn\'t want to yield their power, control and prestige -- history repeats itself for those who are ignorant of it. The shore counties of NJ never cease to amaze me -- might as well be down in the Delta\nGeorge Krebs: It was just another international money grab. He campaigned on this and delivered. We can police ourselves environmentally without any help. If you folks are truly upset, direct your ire toward China or India. Or Leonardo DiCaprio.\nJanet Ellis Ownes: It would cost the USA trillions of dollars for very small results. There must be a better way.\nKatherine Vreeland Bakes: Stop calling us "haters." The fact is that we are all concerned citizens of the world and Donald Trump is wrong every time he does something. Never does the right thing ... never. Because of jealousy, this man will stop at nothing to undo Mr. Obama\'s policies ... and that is what this is all about. Don\'t kid yourself into thinking that it is about anything else.\nBarbara Johnson Haelig: He is a beyond stupid. Cares only for himself. This administration\'s insult to intellect, reason and leadership is disgusting. But then again, he loves the uneducated. Those are his supporters and they should be ashamed of the damage they have done by electing an ignoramus who will stop at nothing to destroy the world, in his effort to bring glory and submission to himself. He\'s not fit to clean the toilets in the White House, let alone reside there.\nMichael Bausenwein:Too much cost for too little results. If all parties committed to the same levels of decrease on the same schedule maybe it could be entertained. Allowing the largest polluters to continue for many years makes no sense!\nRich Viola: America First! We can monitor our own without having be financially penalized by foreign countries! We also should cut out monetary support and aid to most foreign countries and use that money here to grow our economy and jobs!!\nMorgan MacKenzie: Anyone within a few blocks of the ocean or bay will lose their home within the next 10-15 years. Sell now, while you can. Preferably to a Republican or other science-denier.\nMichael De Fortuna: It\'s global warming! No, it\'s been too consistently chilly as of late, so let\'s start calling it climate change! Whatever we do, let\'s be sure to never call it what it really is: a scheme to enrich the likes of Al Gore (whose net worth skyrocketed in the last 20 years) and his close friends! The less people know, the better!\nJanet Ellis Ownes: Just don\'t understand why people don\'t want our Preidents to do well for the country. I really disliked Obama but I still hoped he would do well for out country. Since none of us are in the inside, we really don\'t know what is going on. We listen or watch the news and make decisions based on what they say, whether it is accurate or not.\nJohn J. Pacetti: It\'s will cost the U.S. less to work on clean energy and such within our own country. It\'s not like every company working on alternate fuels, solar power and other clean energy will suddenly give up and go back to burning coal.\nEric Seal: This will put America behind the rest of the world even further taking away innovation opportunity. Trump\'s taking this country on a path to be a banana republic third world nation and China\'s already taking advantage jumping on future jobs the U.S. was on pace to gain. Now America will be sucking on obsolete tailpipes.\nSam Spade: I voted for Trump, but this is a short-sighted act merely to antagonize the prior holder of the office. I can\'t stand Obama, been to the WH to tell him on 6 occasions, but Trump is so possessed with antagonizing the left he has forgotten to run the country.\nMary Kaduthodil: Mr. Trump will be remembered as the President who brought back Black Lung and promoted asthma in America\'s children!\nDavid Behrens Sr: The U.S. has already cut emissions by 23 percent and follows the accord information, without even being involved in it. Plus, and most importantly, the biggest offenders, China and India, don\'t have to do anything, according to the rules, until 2030. Meantime, all we\'re doing is throwing money into the wind and doing the right thing anyway. There is no downside to leaving this accord. No one in America is going to die from it. Lung Cancer will not increase because we left. That\'s nonsense.\nCaption: ASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump announced Thursday that the U.S. will withdraw from the Paris climate change accord.\n'b'British gardens could end up devoid of luscious lawns, with popular plants proving more difficult to grow and plant pests and diseases spreading, according to a new report from the RHS and leading academics into the impact of climate change on gardening.\nPlants will have to cope with increasingly warmer and drier weather in summer, but also more turbulent spells with intense, sometimes unpredictable heavy showers and strong winds.\nThe news is not all bad, though. Gardeners in the north could enjoy a longer growing season, experts say. The wide-ranging report, Gardening in a Changing Climate, looks at both the impact the increase in temperatures is currently having on plants and gardeners, and the future of gardening as temperatures increase.\nThe report is a collaboration between the RHS and academics from the universities of Sheffield, Reading and Coventry, with input from experts from the Met Office. It\'s the first in-depth analysis of the effects of climate change on UK gardening in more than a decade - the RHS last investigated the issue in 2002 with the National Trust and UKCIP (Climate Impacts Programme) to produce the Gardening in the Global Greenhouse report.\nWhile the 2002 report concluded that gardeners would be basking in Mediterranean temperatures and so could grow more plants that thrive in bright, dry conditions, model projections suggest warmer but more variable climatic conditions.\nThe updated report has found that gardeners can expect more extreme weather, characterised by more variable, intense rainfall, combined with an increase in dry summers, which will be most pronounced in the south of the UK.\nGardeners looking to cope with the challenge of increased rainfall may have to adopt new practices to ensure the survival of some of our favourite plants.\nTraditional plants, such as tulips, alliums and asters may have to be planted in raised beds to survive increased rainfall. The extra height will lift their roots clear of the water table.\nThose experiencing higher temperatures may turn to heat-loving plants, such as aloe or lavender.\nLush, green lawns are likely to be a major casualty and may have to be converted to dry meadows, as pressure on water supplies increases.\nNorthern gardeners will be able to grow a wider variety of plants that would have previously struggled to survive in the region, including canna, a tender perennial that produces bold leaves and showy flowers in shades of red, orange, yellows and pinks.\nIn a foreword to the report, Professor Dame Julia Slingo, the former Met Office chief scientist, says: "This report provides some valuable guidance and demonstrates how climate change need not be a disaster for our gardens, but instead provide us with a wealth of opportunities."\nBased on the report, the RHS Garden for a Changing Climate will be unveiled at the first RHS Chatsworth Flower Show in June, designed by Andy Clayden and Dr Ross Cameron of the University of Sheffield and RHS scientist Eleanor Webster. It will show a small suburban garden now and in the future (the year 2100).\nIt will highlight the impacts of climate change on garden style and function as well as feature plants that will be able to cope with the challenges of our future climate.\nDr Cameron says: "Keen gardeners have always enjoyed a challenge, and like to match their skills against the elements, but in future we may have to rely on more robust plant species that have proven their resilience against the extremes of weather: drought conditions one year and water-logging the next."\n\n'b'Michael Clancy: "In Atlantic City, the sea level has risen by an average of one-and-a-half inches per decade since 1912, Broccoli said." So this has been happening for over 100 years? I guess there was a whole lot of CO2 being released in the roaring \'20s.\nKaren Wehrle-Kruimer: Wow for those if you who don\'t believe in climate change, you truly are extremely ignorant. Just look at our beaches and you would have to be a complete fool to ignore this\nRobert Horzepa: Climate change has not "already begun", it has never stopped since our planet was formed and will continue until the ultimate demise of our solar system. It is dynamic and has existed long before the existence of mankind.\nSteve W. Matthews: We have the technology and hopefully enough time to address greenhouse gas emissions, as well as other pollution issues. But there\'s a lot of big money spreading BS and pushing back against any efforts to address this. We actually have a President demanding we burn MORE coal, and he even wants to use government money to subsidize it. All this while the market for coal has pretty much dried up. Meanwhile we have politicians waving around snowballs and claiming more CO2 is good for the environment. ... Politics and corporate money is where the real problem starts in addressing greenhouse gas issues. Otherwise, there\'s no reason why it wouldn\'t be fixable over time.\nAmsden Bernier: And the saddest thing about this is that we have a president in the White House who continues to deny its existence and making deep cuts in the U.S. Environmental Agency and has hurt so many programs in New Jersey where Congressman Frank Pallone For New Jersey 6th District has been the environmental activist for the past 27 years in Congress advocating on its behalf by making the people aware of the effects, changes, hazards, protection and preservation with warnings that everyone should know what is at stake. Now, with Trump as president New Jersey has been hard hit in bureaucracies, political revenge by Christie and Trump with lack of funding for study, research and development and making it harder.Climate is real and everyone should accept the fact and stop denying it!\nCliff Galbraith: So for those of you who don\'t believe in climate change, the recent draft of the report released several days ago was by these 13 U.S. government agencies:  which included the Dept. of Defense and NASA -- not exactly known for being a bunch of silly hippies. But of course Alex Jones and others know better?\nKathy Bird: You should talk to farmers in Monmouth and Ocean county and at Rutgers, etc., because warmer temps are affecting crop yields and timing and agriculture is trying to adjust.\nCaption: ~File photo Barnegat Light on Long Beach Island is the symbol for the Jersey Shore, but it is at risk of inundation by rising sea levels associated by climate change.\n'b'Generation Zero is right behind the  Zero Carbon Act, says Gord Stewart\nIF you want something profoundly important accomplished, here\'s a recipe for success: Get young people to do it. And don\'t pay them.\nThat seems to be the case with climate change action and the proposal for a Zero Carbon Act. Perhaps it\'s enough for them just to know their future depends on it.\nGeneration Zero launched its blueprint for a Zero Carbon Act at Parliament in early April. It\'s a call for a powerful new climate change law to get New Zealand to zero carbon by 2050 or sooner. It\'s a natural for cross-party support in government. It needs and deserves our support, too.\nEstablished in 2011, Generation Zero is a national organisation of young people who aren\'t waiting around for politicians to protect our future. They\'re all volunteers, working to raise awareness about climate change issues and to propose and implement practical solutions. They receive occasional grants and small donations, but generally do their great work on a shoestring budget - on the smell of an oily rag, really.\nWhy does New Zealand need such an act? Through the Paris Climate Accord, countries of the world agreed to limit warming to below 2C above pre-industrial levels. This requires global CO2 emissions to reach net zero by early in the second half of the century, along with deep cuts in other greenhouse gas emissions.\nMany countries are responding and seeing great progress through innovation and efficiency. Sadly, New Zealand is not one of them. Our greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise and there is no plan to meet even the inadequate reduction targets the Government has set.\nThe UK Climate Change Act, passed in 2008, is proof that such a plan can work. The framework put in place allows politicians to think beyond election cycles and work together. CO2 emissions have fallen 28 per cent since the act was passed, to a level last observed in 1894.\nOthers are following suit. Similar legal frameworks are now in place in Finland, Denmark and Ireland, and in several states and provinces in the United States, Australia and Canada. Sweden will soon introduce a law committing to be carbon neutral by 2045. Seven of eight parliamentary parties support it.\nWe can do it, too. The proposed Zero Carbon Act will commit New Zealand to zero carbon by 2050, set a legally binding pathway to reach the target, and require the Government to make a plan.\nA crucial part of the act will be the establishment of an independent Climate Commission. It would consist of an expert panel appointed by Parliament and have two main functions: to provide advice on targets, policies and climate risks and to hold the Government accountable. This is crucial as climate change action is too important to leave to whether the government-of-the-day cares or not.\nThe act would have a number of key principles, including a transition that is fair and cost-effective, an honouring of the Treaty of Waitangi, and attention to intergenerational equity.\nThe act would set separate targets for long-lived greenhouse gases (mainly carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide) and short-lived ones (mainly methane). Sensitive to the particular impacts on agriculture, short-lived gases will have to be reduced to sustainable levels, but not zero.\nThe act would also ensure a comprehensive national response to the now inevitable impacts of climate change. This will require a five-yearly national climate risk assessment and an adaptation programme to address the identified risks.\nFinally, the act will ensure New Zealand delivers on its international climate change obligations in a transparent manner. This includes duties under the Paris Agreement to support efforts in developing countries, such as our low-lying Pacific island neighbours.\nGeneration Zero is currently gathering petitions in support of the act (see \'More Info\'), but will wait to have it tabled in Parliament after the election.\nHopefully the parties in power then will see the wisdom of such an act. There\'s nowhere to hide from climate change. Together we can do what\'s needed.\nIn a heartfelt call to action, Lisa McLaren, Zero Carbon Act campaign convener, said, "Let\'s get to work tackling the greatest challenge of our time and stand united as a nation that values reason, fairness and our children\'s futures."\nGord Stewart is an environmental sustainability consultant. He does project work for government, industry, and non-profit organisations.\n'b'It has been a wild and wet 2017. As Typhoon Hato battered Hong Kong and Macau in August, grounding flights and killing 10 people, hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria unleashed hell on the Americas, killing hundreds.\nEarlier this month, Khanun closed in on Hong Kong as the fifth typhoon requiring the issuing of a No 8 signal, a rare occurrence so late in the year. No 8 signals are the third level in a five-tier storm warning system used in Hong Kong and Macau.\nTyphoons, hurricanes and -cyclones are the same thing, but have different names depending on which ocean they form over.\nThey brew near the equator, where warm ocean water evaporates and forms clouds with areas of lower pressure below. The clouds and wind grow and spin faster into a whirling mass, and when wind speeds reach 118km/h, the storm is classed a -typhoon.\nFollowing Hato, the question was once again being raised: is -climate change causing more -typhoons and stronger typhoons? There was no simple or conclusive answer to the question, atmospheric scientist Professor Johnny Chan Chung-leung said.\nThe simple way of looking at typhoons is that warming of oceans leads to more evaporation into the atmosphere, which feeds storms and provides conditions to make them form more often. But atmospheric factors could also -affect their formation, Chan said.\nSinking air in the upper atmosphere, for example, could put pressure on a typhoon and prevent it from rising and developing. Vertical wind shear at different heights of atmosphere could -suppress convection or cause a -typhoon\'s cylindrical column to slant, diminishing its strength.\n"Whether typhoons, under global warming, will become more frequent or strong, depends on factors relating to both the ocean and atmosphere. The problem, however, no one can find -evidence whether atmospheric conditions are becoming less or more favourable," Chan said.\nScientists have been able to gather complete data on storms and measure their intensity only since the 1980s, when the technology for digital and infrared -cameras improved.\nSecond, "if you look at statistics of typhoons that made landfall from 1998 onwards, the whole South China coast or South China Sea had seen fewer tropical -cyclones, not more", Chan, the director of Hong Kong City -University\'s Guy Carpenter Asia-Pacific Climate Impact Centre, pointed out.\nIn Hong Kong\'s case, the city has actually seen fewer powerful typhoons of late. According to the Hong Kong Observatory, there was roughly one No 10 typhoon - the strongest signal indicating winds of 118km/h or more - per year between 1960 and 1964, and one every four or five years from 1960 to 1980.\nTyphoon York in 1999 bucked the trend, hitting the city 16 years after Typhoon Ella in 1983. Only two No 10 signals have been issued since then - Vicente in 2012 and Hato in August.\nBut what international scientists seem to agree on is this: global warming will make future extreme weather events, when they happen, more powerful, wreak-ing greater damage.\n"So far, from our decades of research, there appear to be natural cycles in typhoon activity, regardless of activity or intensity. -Climate change will alter these -cycles," Chan said.\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres highlighted this during a recent tripto hurricane-ravaged Antigua, Barbuda and Dominica, where he said it was not possible to link a single weather event to climate change. But he acknowledged that scientists were predicting that extreme weather events would be "the new normal of a warming world".\nHe gave an example: "A warmer climate turbocharges the intensity of hurricanes. Instead of dissipating, they pick up fuel as they move across the ocean."\nThe oceans are getting warmer due to the greenhouse effect, where gases in the atmosphere, such as water vapour, absorb heat radiated from the Earth to space and re-emit them in all directions. Oceans have a higher heat capacity than air and absorb 90 per cent of this extra heat.\nInternational research already shows stronger typhoons making landfall in the northwest Pacific.\nA 2016 study led by Professor Wei Mei of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and -published in the journal Nature Geo-science found that storms -hitting China, Japan, Korea and the Philippines had grown 50 per cent stronger on average since 1977, largely due to warming of oceans.\nJust this month, Super -Typhoon Lan slammed into the eastern part of Japan, killing at least five people. And in the north Atlantic, a tropical cyclone gained strength as it headed towards Ireland, confounding scientists who said it was rare for a storm travelling in that direction to stay as strong, as ocean waters typically got colder at higher latitudes.\nChan has recently been testing what he claims is a probable hypothesis - that global warming could be forcing tropical storms to migrate to latitudes further north.\nTo find out if his theory holds water, Chan has examined 500 years of data on China dating back to the Ming dynasty. He is also working with Korean and Japanese meteorologists to gather similar data to get the full picture.\n"If we find evidence that there have been south-to-north migrations of typhoons in the past, then it might not be because of global warming. But if it has never happened, we\'ll be more confident in saying global warming [has had an impact]," Chan said.\nIn addition to supercharging storms, the warmer climate feeds other elements that cause storms to do more damage, such as -massive flooding on land.\nWith more vapour in the atmosphere, rainfall is more intense. And the extra heat is melting arctic sea ice and glaciers, raising global sea levels by an average of 19cm from 1901 to 2015, or about 1.7mm per year.\nAround Hong Kong, the rise in sea levels was projected to continue at a rate of 2.4 to 2.77mm per year, the Observatory said.\nObservatory director Shun Chi-ming previously warned that rising sea levels, coupled with storm surges from tropical cyclones, would increase the chance of flooding in coastal areas.\nThe city got a taste of this during Hato. As the typhoon crossed to the south of the city in August, the sea level around parts of Hong Kong rose by up to 4.5 metres.\nThe damage was much worse in Macau. Hato left half of the city without water and electricity, claimed 10 lives and caused US$1.4 billion in economic losses.\nPiet Dircke, global leader for water management at Dutch environmental and engineering consultancy Arcadis, said Hong Kong should think about building flood walls and multi-purpose dykes, or even mangroves or sandbanks for less inhabited areas.\nSecretary for Security John Lee Ka-chiu recently told lawmakers that the government had formulated "contingency plans to cope with all types of natural disasters".\nHe said that between 1961 and 2011, about six tropical cyclones a year came within 500km of Hong Kong. Storm surges of more than 3.5 metres happened just three times in Hong Kong harbour in the post-war era, the most recent during Typhoon Hato.\nDircke said government -investment in flood protection sometimes took a back seat due to its high cost, with no real quantifiable "return period".\nBut there was simply no use in preparing for a rainy day only after catastrophe hit, he said.\n"That\'s exactly what happened in New Orleans, New York and Houston and many cases in Asia. Hong Kong should be smart and learn lessons from others."\nIllustration: Kaliz Lee\nCredit: Ernest Kao\n'b'The unsettling science of climate change has apparently rattled more than 300 scientists, who have written to President Trump, urging him to withdraw from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\nIt is from this framework -- actually an international treaty signed in 1992 -- that the U.N. has advanced various wealth-transferring "climate" initiatives, the latest being the Paris accord, which President Obama signed without Senate ratification.\nThe problem with this and other climate initiatives is that they are "not scientifically justified" and they offer "no environmental benefits," writes Richard Lindzen, an MIT professor emeritus and climate-change skeptic.\nOn the other hand, 700 companies and investors (think Al Gore) have signed a statement urging Mr. Trump to abide by the latest climate treaty that was never constitutionally ratified. And whereas the U.S. and other wealthy nations are supposed to curb their carbon under this accord, the treaty itself is non-binding.\nWhat the venture capitalists of climate change conveniently disregard is the economic toll of cutting off affordable fossil fuels in developing nations. "It condemns over 4 billion people in still-undeveloped countries to continued poverty," writes Mr. Lindzen.\nFor too long the hot air surrounding the so-called "settled science" of climate change has shut out legitimate scientific inquiry and dissent. A fresh perspective from the White House is long overdue.\n'b'\nThe Ministry of Environment, Climate Change and Natural Resources recently held a day-long Regional Consultative Workshop on Strategic Programme on Climate Resilient at the regional education conference hall in Brikama, West Coast Region (WCR). \nSpeaking at the opening ceremony, the regional governor of WCR, Ebrima Mballow spoke at length on the significant of the forum. "We are gathered here today to support the government in the formulation of its programme document on climate resilient. Therefore, our participation is very crucial so that at the end of the day, we are able to come out with a very rich document on climate resilient," he added.\nThe WCR regional governor spoke at length on the impact of climate change, adding that climate change resilient development is about ensuring that people\'s business and organization are able to curb with the current climate vulnerability as well added to future climate change praising development gains and minimizing damages.\nGovernor Mballow added that climate risk cannot be eliminated but negative impact on people can be reduced or managed. "I am optimistic that the workshop was of great, especially to the formation of the strategic programme on climate resilient development".\nHe thanked the ministry of environment for coming out with such an important national development document. He equally commended African Development Bank (ADB) for supporting the government in preparing the document.\nFor his part, Pa Ousman Jarju, the former Minister of Environment dilated on the significance of the document, adding that they are going to look at rural resilient, food security, livelihoods among others in the strategic document.\nThe former minister said they were also going to look at the capacity building coordination as to how the government is going to coordinate climate change issues. "We will also look at cross cutting issues on gender, health, education, tourism, youth among others. At the end of the day we will develop a report, which will be validated and we will develop and investment plan that will be submitted to government," he noted.\nHe continued: "The purpose of the forum is to ensure that we have ownership of the document," he said.

In addition, the Group is also the official partner for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), completed by its existing partnership with the City of Bonn in the course of COP23. Fiji will be presiding over COP23 as President while UN Climate Change will be hosting the conference at its headquarters in Bonn, with the support of the German Government and the City of Bonn. The event is taking place from November 6 to 17 at the UN Campus and Rheinaue-Park Bonn, on either side of Deutsche Post DHL Group\'s headquarters. Approximately 20,000 guests from around the globe are expected to join the summit.\n"The drua is the symbol on Fiji\'s COP23 Presidency. It is a reminder to the entire world that we are all in the same canoe when it comes to climate change. We must fill the sail of this canoe with a collective determination to move the climate action agenda forward," said Peniana Lalabalavu, Chief Coordinator for the COP23 Presidency. "We would like to express our gratitude for the amazing support provided by Deutsche Post DHL Group, which has used its international network and specialist experience to transfer the drua and other artifacts to Bonn".\nDeutsche Post DHL Group is not only supporting its partners by providing climate neutral shipping services and logistics support but also helping to facilitate the conference by offering spaces and meeting areas. Additionally, the Group is also organizing an extensive program ranging from exhibitions of its e-fleet to activities promoting sustainability such as tree planting initiatives involving employees as well as Bonn citizens. "We are proud to join forces with Fiji and the UN Climate Change, united in our common goal of protecting the environment. Green logistics can play a key role in combating climate change. This is why we have introduced our GoGreen Mission 2050 that aims to reduce our own logistics-related emissions to net zero by 2050, leading the way into a new era of sustainable logistics." says Christof Ehrhart, Executive Vice President Corporate Communications and Corporate Responsibility at Deutsche Post DHL Group.\nNick Nuttall, Spokesperson and Director of the Communication and Outreach Program (CO), UN Climate Change adds: "UN Climate Change is honored to be hosting COP 23 and is determined to support strong and positive outcomes that will advance climate action across the globe. Deutsche Post DHL Group is a strong supporter of our joint endeavor working towards a sustainable future and as well an ideal partner for realizing our ambitions to make the event of the COP 23 environmentally-friendly".\nSustainability and responsibility are integral components of Deutsche Post DHL Group\'s corporate strategy, In 2008 the Group became the first global player in the logistics industry to establish a climate protection target. This goal - to improve its carbon efficiency by 30% over the 2007 baseline by the year 2020 - was achieved in 2016, four years ahead of schedule. In 2017 the company set its sights on another ambitious goal: by 2050 the Group wants to reduce all transport-related emissions to net zero and thus contribute to the \'well below\' 2 degrees Celsius global warming goal established at the 2015 UN Paris Climate Conference (COP 21). Already back in 2013, Deutsche Post DHL Group made Bonn a model city for carbon-free delivery vehicles, and today operates more than 100 of the Group\'s own StreetScooters in the Bonn region.\nDHL Trade Fairs & Events delivers Fijian exhibits to Bonn\nAs an official partner, DHL Trade Fairs & Events (TFE), a business unit of DHL Freight, is responsible for special logistics and has supported the construction of the conference site. As a symbol of this partnership and the conference itself, the business unit transported a Fijian double-hull sailing canoe, a drua from the National Maritime Museum (NMM) in Greenwich, London, to Bonn to be exhibited in the World Conference Center, the heart of the so-called "Bula Zone" where the COP23 negotiations will take place. NMM is the owner of the drua and has loaned it to the Fijian Presidency for the duration of the COP23. The transport was realized by an aerodynamic DHL Teardrop Trailer. The truck has a curved roof which reduces air resistance, hence cutting fuel consumption by up to ten percent compared to regular heavy-load trucks.\nMSTRUCK-6049574 MSTRUCK\n'b'The American Society of Landscape Architects issued the following news release:\nThe American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) is one of nine exemplar organizations exhibiting the most comprehensive approaches to educating and engaging their members, according to a report released today by the Kresge Foundation.\nThe Kresge report, "Professional Societies and Climate Change," analyzes how professional societies are helping their members integrate climate change into their thinking and decision making. Researchers found that the professional societies most engaged on climate issues recognize the substantial impacts that climate change will have on their missions and membership.\nASLA has identified climate change as a key issue for its members, according to ASLA Executive Vice President and CEO Nancy Somerville, Hon. ASLA.\n"ASLA is honored to be recognized by the Kresge Foundation," said Somerville. "Most landscape architects acknowledge the reality of climate change, and as a result their work helps make communities more resilient and better able to recover from disruptive climate events."\nThe Society provides substantial climate mitigation resources, including a policy statement on climate change and a code of environmental ethics; a Professional Practice Network focused on Sustainable Design and Development; a webpage on combating climate change with numerous mitigation-related resources; a resource guide on increasing energy efficiency and an energy efficient home landscapes animation. Various articles in Landscape Architecture Magazine (LAM) and blog The Dirt are related to mitigation, such as a 2014 post on "How to create a climate change mitigation and adaptation plan." In addition, a working group was formed to provide input on model codes within ASHRAE 189.1 specific to site sustainability and water use.\nClimate adaption resources developed by ASLA includes a webpage on combatting climate change; resource centers for critical issues like storm water; resource guides on topics like green infrastructure, livable communities and sustainable transportation; and a new Guide to Resilient Design.\nASLA works with educators and schools through the Council of Educators of Landscape Architecture. ASLA\'s "Landscape Architecture Continuing Education System" (LA CES) has offered courses on adaptation, such as the 2012 "Landscape Systems, Urban Heat Island, and Climate Change: a landscape architecture approach to adapt." The Society helped to develop The Sustainable Sites Initiative (SITES(TM)), a rating system for the sustainable design, construction and maintenance of landscapes now owned by Green Business Certification Inc. (GBCI).\nThe Society is also engaged in political advocacy and public education on the topic of resilience and social justice. It will convene an interdisciplinary blue ribbon task force later this year to develop climate change- and resilience-related public policy recommendations.\nIn addition to ASLA, other professional societies on the list include the American Planning Association, the American Public Health Association, the American Society of Civil Engineers, the American Water Works Association, the International City/County Management Association, National League of Cities, the National Medical Association and the Urban Land Institute.\nThe report was authored by independent climate adaptation consultant Dr. Missy Stults and Ph.D. researcher and consultant Sara Meerow.\nAbout the American Society of Landscape Architects\nFounded in 1899, ASLA is the national professional association for landscape architects, representing more than 15,000 members in 49 professional chapters and 72 student chapters. Members of the Society use "ASLA" after their names to denote membership and their commitment to the highest ethical standards of the profession. Landscape architects lead the stewardship, planning and design of our built and natural environments; the Society\'s mission is to advance landscape architecture through advocacy, communication, education and fellowship.\n[Category: Construction]\n30FurigayJane-5750659 30FurigayJane\n'b'The impact of climate change is often seen in cataclysmic terms, with rising seas, melting ice caps and increasingly unstable conditions bringing death and destruction in many parts of the world.\nBut changes in the UK climate could have a less alarming, but no less dramatic impact for keen gardeners.\nExperts warn it could mean an end to "immaculate" lawns and the rise of new plant pests and diseases.\nAccording to a report drier summers and more frequent days of "extreme rainfall" in the winter will see Britons face a greater challenge to maintain their gardens, the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) said.\nIts report, compiled with input from Met Office experts and university academics, analysed the potential impact of climate change on the nation\'s gardens and found a North-South divide in what gardeners can expect.\nThe south of England is predicted to become warmer and drier, while the country north of Northampton is set to be cooler and wetter, resulting in an extended growing season.\nAn RHS survey of 1,000 gardeners found those in the north reported mowing their lawns more often than those in the south.\nThe RHS concluded the change could mean gardens will need more mowing, weeding and pruning and a wider variety of plants could be grown, while gardeners will have to take steps to ensure the survival of flowers such as the tulip, aster and allium in increased rainfall.\nThe report said: "Variability in the weather has always challenged UK gardeners, but this aspect may get worse and lead to frustrations when attempting to grow some species. "Survival may not be the only issue - poor garden per-formance year on year, for instance a lack of spring blossom or consistent autumn colour, may lead to some genera losing popularity.\n"Advocates of immaculate, well-watered lawns and Edwardian herbaceous borders ... may have their work cut out to maintain standards."\nRHS climate scientist and co-author of the report, Dr Eleanor Webster, said: "Increasing housing pressures will exacerbate the possible implications of climate change outlined in the report. As a result, gardens will become increasingly important for flood protection, local climate buffering and as vital green spaces for wildlife.\n"The threat to our gardens and green spaces from climate change is very real and is happening now."\nGuy Barter, RHS chief horticulturist, said advances in climate science since the last report in 2002 had shown its prediction of Mediterranean temperatures was now more varied.\nHe told the BBC: "I think we are really looking back about 20 to 30 years and in that time the growing season has got longer, average temperatures have gone up.\n"We can take a much more nuanced view of it now. Fifteen years ago we tended to think it was going to be a Mediterranean climate in the summer and the wet, warm winters.\n"Now we can see the climate is going to be much more variable."\n\nCREDIT: Scott D\'Arcy\nCAPTION: Thing of the past? Climate change could cost British gardeners their immaculate lawns\n'b'Climate change could cost the world\'s major cities twice as much as the rest of the planet because of the extra heat created by the urban jungle, researchers have warned.\nThe "urban heat island" effect is caused by replacing plants and other natural features with heat-trapping concrete and asphalt and by the impact of heat from sources such as cars and air-conditioning units.\nIt could add around 2C to temperature rises caused by global warming in the world\'s most populated cities by 2050, with economic impacts of hotter conditions ranging from more energy use for air conditioning to health risks and less productive workers.\nAnalysis by a team of economists of 1,692 of the world\'s major cities shows the total economic costs of climate change for the urban areas could be 2.6 times higher when heat island effects are taken into account than when they are not.\nLosses could reach 10.9% of economic output for the worst-affected cities by the end of the century, compared with a global average of 5.6%, the analysis published in the journal Nature Climate Change found.\nBut local efforts to reduce temperatures, such as switching to "cool" pavements and roofs which reflect the sun and absorb less heat, could have significant benefits for cities.\nChanging a fifth of a city\'s roofs and half its pavements to "cool" versions, which are lighter or more reflective than traditional ones, could reduce air temperatures by 0.8C and deliver savings worth up to 12 times what they cost to install and maintain.\nImplementing measures at a larger scale could produce even bigger benefits, but would cost significantly more, a cost-benefit analysis by the researchers from the University of Sussex, Universidad Nacional Autonoma Mexico and Vrije University Amsterdam found.\nThey also found the positive impacts of local measures such as implementing cool pavements are amplified when global efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions and curb temperature rises are also having an effect.\nProfessor Richard Tol, from the University of Sussex, said: "Any hardwon victories over climate change on a global scale could be wiped out by the effects of uncontrolled urban heat islands. We show that city-level adaptation strategies to limit local warming have important economic net benefits for almost all cities around the world.\n"The largest benefits for reducing the impacts of climate change are attained when both global and local measures are implemented together."\n\nCREDIT: Emily Beament\nCAPTION: Replacing plants and other natural features with heat-trapping concrete and asphalt in London could add around 2C to temperature rises\n'b'Singapore is breaking new tem-perature records every year, the weather is getting increasingly erratic and the country is pun-ching above its weight when it comes to producing harmful carbon emissions.\nYet, while most people here are concerned about the effects of climate change, a significant portion do not believe their actions can make a difference to the country\'s carbon footprint.\nThe authorities are trying to change this attitude.\n"We feel it is important to raise the level of national consciousness around the need to take individual and collective action to fight climate change," Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli said yesterday at the launch of Singapore\'s Year of Climate Action.\nAs part of this effort, people and organisations will, for instance, be able to make a Climate Action Pledge, where they can declare publicly what they want to do to make Singapore greener.\nIndividuals can promise to recycle, take public transport, walk or cycle, while organisations can raise office temperatures by 1 deg C to 2 deg C, for example. More than 210 pledges have been made so far.\nThe effort is timely.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingapore may contribute just 0.11 per cent of global emissions, but it ranks 26th out of 142 countries in terms of emissions per capita, according to 2015 data from the International Energy Agency.\nThis means that each person here produces more carbon emissions than his counterpart in Britain, Switzerland or France, for instance.\n\nSingapore may contribute just 0.11 per cent of global emissions, but it ranks 26th out of 142 countries in terms of emissions per capita, according to 2015 data from the International Energy Agency.\n\nBut one in three respondents of a 2016 survey here believes that what he does will not have any impact on this figure. This is even though nine out of 10 were concerned about the effects of climate change on future generations.\nDisagreeing, Mr Masagos said that tackling climate change cannot be the work of the Government alone.\n"Taking action individually all adds up... towards making sure that climate change is not as adverse as predicted," Mr Masagos told reporters.\nA climate action blog has also been launched at www.climateaction.sg, which will be a resource for those looking for ways to cut their carbon footprint.\nAsked if his ministry will consider punitive measures for individuals, whether through the implementation of pay-as-you-throw schemes or a plastic bag tax, Mr Masagos would say only that his ministry\'s focus for this year is the carbon tax, which will be levied on large emitters in 2019.\n"This is a year when we will join forces with all of you here, plus many other parties across Singapore and beyond, to rally everybody to take action to reduce our carbon footprint and fight climate change," Mr Masagos said yesterday, even as he reaffirmed Singapore\'s commitment to meeting its targets under the Paris Agreement, an international effort to limit global warming.\nSingapore will be hosting a Special Asean Ministerial Meeting on Climate Change in July, Mr Masagos said, and this will be an important meeting for Asean to show leadership on climate action.\nOn the ground, there are already encouraging initiatives. The Nature Society (Singapore) is planning to organise activities such as talks and forums to show how climate change affects biodiversity.\nEnvironmental scientist Pui Cuifen, 36, is also on a personal campaign to urge marathon or-ganisers to become greener. This includes providing recycling bins along marathon routes to re-cycle cups, and collecting waste from bananas given out at events for composting.\nMs Nor Lastrina Hamid, co-founder of the Singapore Youth for Climate Action, said the Government\'s effort was a good start.\n"I thought it was good to designate this year as the Year of Climate Action, for some branding and emphasis at the national level. But whether or not the various movements are strategic enough to affect change at a national level - that remains to be seen."\nCREDIT: Audrey Tan\n'b'Rabat , Sept. 20 -- Saad Abid, ecologist and president of Associaton Bahri, has been invited by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to attend a high level meeting for Climate Week 2017 at the UN headquarters In New York City.\nThe meeting will bring together 40 global climate leaders to discuss strategies to realize the actions of the Paris Agreement.\nGuterres will hosting the meeting, which will be attended by the former Moroccan Minister Delegate in Charge of Environment Hakima El Haite, and the businessman and former NYC mayor Michael Bloomberg.\nIn addition to El Haite, Inia Seruiratu, the Minister of Agriculture, Rural and Marine Development and National Disaster Management in Fidji, and Patricia Espinosa the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), invited Abid to help establish the founders group of the climate action leadership network.\nThe group is a network of key decision-makers (ministers, mayors, scientists, and civil society leaders) that aim to deliver immediate climate action.\nAbid is the only representative of Moroccan civil society on the group.

In fact, the telethon needed more moments like it.\nKevin Fallon\n09.13.17 6:45 AM ET\nAt a time when fewer people than ever watch television live, how does a telethon have an impact? By going viral.\nDuring Tuesdays cross-network and cross-platform airing of Hand in Hand: A Benefit for Hurricane Relief, that mission, certainly secondary to that of raising funds to benefit the victims of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, was accomplished seconds into the telecast.\nStevie Wonder, the first of the Oscar red carpets worth of celebrities to make heartfelt pleas for donations via live feeds in Los Angeles, New York, Nashville, and San Antonio, seemed to kick things off innocently enough, with platitudes of coming together to love those who have been devastated by the storms, regardless of political persuasions.\nADVERTISING\ninRead invented by Teads\nWell, except, Wonder instantly got political.\nAnyone who believes there is no such thing as global warming must be blind, or unintelligent, he said, practically dropping the mic before the show even started. Lord save us all.\nWas it exactly George Bush doesnt care about black people? No, of course not. But it was a potentially polarizing and alienating move at a time when, even as images of the powerful storms and monumental wreckage they caused literally flooded our screens, the impulse, especially from politicians, to call for prayers in lieu of recognizing science has become an exasperated meme.\nTo wit, even after we tweeted out Wonders quote, we got responses chiding the singer for undermining the objective of the telethon by alienating half the country in the first 30 seconds.\nRelated in Entertainment\nJAY-Z Finally Breaks Silence on Solange Elevator Beatdown\nColdplays Man-Made Disaster in Response to Hurricane Harvey\nHas Taylor Swifts Girl Squad Abandoned Her?\nWere Wonders comments unscripted, like Kanye Wests were in 2005 at the telethon for Hurricane Katrina aid? Its too soon to know that yet. (Its not like there was teleprompter copy for Stevie Wonder.)\nBut its worth noting that Wonder wasnt the only celebrity to address the elephant in the room of climate change, raising eyebrows in the otherwise characteristically congenial and earnest-often to a fault-affair.\nIn fact, it was arguably the programs biggest booking, Beyonc, who also brought it up-and in a pre-taped video at that, eschewing the idea that at the very least her comments could have been spontaneous. It hints that, for maybe the first time in an event like this, organizers werent just amenable to the idea of political truth bombs amidst the sob stories and scenes of tragedy, but explicitly encouraged it.\nThe effects of climate change are playing out around the world every day. Just this past week youve seen devastation from the monsoon in India, an 8.1 earthquake in Mexico, and two catastrophic hurricanes, Beyonc said, regally narrating our end times. We have to be prepared for what comes next.\nIts interesting to look at the way we remember Kanye Wests comments, standing next to a flabbergasted Mike Myers, all these years later. The knee-jerk labeling of inappropriate has evolved, generally speaking, into finding it mostly hilarious.\nBut what West did was bold. He took the artifice out of the proceedings, called out the bullshit in the self-congratulation of celebrities who happily rearrange their schedules for events like these maybe because its a good deed, but maybe also because in a weird way its a status symbol to be invited to present at one of these things, like a christening to the A-list.\nThere was a certain hypocrisy then in soliciting donations to help a government that was systematically failing a targeted demographic of its citizens. And he wasnt going to stand there and pretend that there wasnt.\nIt may not have been as incendiary, but Stevie Wonder and Beyonc making a plea to acknowledge climate change similarly evades any intrinsic hypocrisy. How could all these celebrities, so many who used their voices so loudly in the previous election, stand in front of footage of those floods and not talk about the urgent contributing factor that the party in power refuses to blame?\nIn fact, politics, even in the telethons name, slyly pervaded most of the night.\nHand in Hand refers to both how Americans helped each other regardless of background as the water levels rose, but also how, as a country in an explosive time of cultural divide, we must put aside our politics to assist in overcoming this devastation as one.\nNational disasters dont discriminate, Beyonc said. They dont see if youre an immigrant, black or white, Hispanic, or Asian, Jewish, or Muslim, rich or poor. It doesnt matter if youre from Third Ward or River Oaks, were all in this together. Most speakers, which included everyone from Tom Hanks to Leonardo DiCaprio to Will Smith, spoke about how heartened they were to see discrimination and opposition be cast aside to assist those in need, because thats what real American values are.\nIt might seem bleak that an event like this would need to repeatedly remind us of that, as if were worried that might no longer be our instinct. And it might seem absurd that political parties and agendas, mentioned in speeches from The Rock to organizer Scooter Braun, are even brought into a telethon about weather, but thats the situation of 2017, upsetting as that is.\nAnd the truth is, thats precisely what a telethon in 2017 needs in order to be effective. The sanitized, emotionally manipulating hodgepodge of montages, testimonials, and musical performances seems dated in an age where viewers seek out and respond to point of view.\nAs news stories poured in about immigrants refusing to be admitted to storm shelters out of fear of being reported, or how racial inequality in major affected cities left low-income communities, and, often, minorities most susceptible to the dangers of flooding, the door was left wide open for charged political statements-even if these telethons arent typically viewed as appropriate outlets for that.\nBut times have changed. In fact, the traditional elements of this telecast were its weakest points.\n??Just got the word, over 15 MILLION was raised tonight. You guys are AMAZING!!!! Had such a good time speaking to all of you. #HandinHand pic.twitter.com/BjxwWQaPrs\n- NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) September 13, 2017\nSo much of it is familiar. You couldve pretty much predicted the set list before the show even began.\nLean on Me? Check, courtesy of Stevie Wonder. You bet Tori Kelly has Hallelujah covered. Usher and Blake Shelton did a competent Stand by Me, while the supergroup of Darius Rucker, Demi Lovato, Brad Paisley, and CeCe Winans took us to church from Nashville.\nThe stories of resilience, bravery, and selflessness that the celebrities told dutifully made you cry.\nCher and Oprah Winfrey, arm-in-arm, tell a story about a human chain that formed to help an elderly man. Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon have a tragic tale about a little girl whose mother died clutching her, attempting to save her from the floodwaters.\nTom Hanks and Rita Wilson wring out your tear ducts talking about wide-eyed babies holding onto each other while waiting to be saved from a rooftop, while Julia Roberts and George Clooney remember the man who played the piano while the waters rose in his house: Lets make sure there are always songs to fill the air.\nIn between it all, everyones favorite camera shots: the rows of phone banks manned by real-life famous people, fielding your calls for donations. Barbra Streisand, Andy Cohen, Nicki Minaj, Julianne Moore, Ryan Seacrest, Bruce Willis, Robert De Niro, Jon Stewart, Sofia Vergara: Theyre all there, and more.\nWe mentioned the impact of these telethons going viral. Gone are the days in which well gather round a TV because its amusing to see Marcia Gay Harden answer the telephone. But, as every shot of those phone banks showed, these celebrities were Instagramming the hell out of this telethon-a truly clever way to drum up more reach for these charities.\nA photo of Sofia Vergara smelling Oprahs ponytail while pleading for money? Sure! Ryan Seacrest posing next to Daniel Craig? That hotline number is the caption. Roughly 400 selfies with various celebs from Rita Wilsons account? Yes please. Each gets a like-and hopefully a donation, too.\nTheres no discounting the nobility and the generosity of any talent that takes part in a massive event like this, which seems like an unprecedented undertaking and monumental achievement-sadly, until the next one comes along.\nWere merely commenting on how much harder it is to generate buzz about them as an event in a society that, forget any political divides, is more splintered in their pop culture habits than ever.\nMight the possibility of an impassioned political swipe at Donald Trump lure more viewers to the telecast? Undoubtedly. Look to the moments that have resonated from any recent awards show for proof of that.\nAs theyve done with this hurricane telethon-and the dozens of aid-generating events like it that have taken place in the past-these famous faces are more than happy to use their clout to raise money and awareness. What were seeing as more effective than ever, and perhaps even wish there was more of in Hand in Hand, is them using their voices. In the meantime, their social-media accounts are a good start.\n'b"Publication: The Columbia Spectator, Columbia University, New York NY.\nBarnards board of trustees voted to accept the Presidential Task Force to Examine Divestments recommendation to divest from companies that deny climate change, as well as companies that mine coal and tar sands, Barnard President Debora Spar announced in an email on Saturday.\nThe decision comes more than a year after calls from student activist group Divest Barnard for the college to divest from fossil fuels. The task force, which began analyzing the financial and economic paths toward divestment for the college in February, published its findings in a report and announced its recommendation in December.\nWeve got overwhelming support by the board, Chief Operating Officer Rob Goldberg, who served as the chair of the task force, said. I think the board is excited about this, we think its the right thing to do for the college, and now we just have the challenge of implementation, which we know will be the next big effort, and we're looking forward to taking that on.\nGoldberg, who will officially become interim president of the college when Spar ends her term on Sunday, said that the first step following the boards approval will be to come up with a working definition of climate deniers. Then, the college will look to analyze companies that may fit this criteria and work with an endowment manager to implement the new policy.\nGoldberg also noted that Barnard is the only college or University to divest from fossil fuels using this method, and said he hopes that Barnard can lead other institutions to do the same.\nWe dont think that Barnard alone is going to move the needle much, but we think if we start something and we prove that we can do it, we might attract others and will create a chorus of voices that could have an impact down the road, so this has potential, Goldberg said.\nCheck back for updates.\njessica.spitz@columbiaspectator.com | @jjspitz1\nCredit: Jessica Spitz\n"b"By Omiko Awa\nGreg Mbajiorgu\n\nGreg Mbajiorgu (a.k.a Wota na Wota), exponent of solo/ecological theatre, is the first African to publish a monodrama. He is also the first to launch in print a seminal drama on climate change. His eco-drama, Wake Up Everyone, won the first prize for Arts and Humanities Research at the 2012 Inter-Universities Research and Development competition, organised by the National Universities Commission (NUC). From 1991 to 2000, during his self-sponsored historic national tour with his one-man show (The Prime Minister's Son), Mbajiorgu recorded over 600 successful performances in universities, secondary schools, army barracks, cultural centres and other educational institutions within and outside the country. The senior lecturer in the Department of Theatre and Film Studies, University of Nigeria (UNN), Nsukka, in this interview with OMIKO AWA, sheds light on issues relating to drama, climate change and theatre of extreme minimalism, popularly referred to as one-man-show art or monodrama. \n\nYou recently won an award with your play, Wake Up Everyone, on climate change. Could you throw more light on that award? \nYES, Wake Up Everyone, my first experimental drama on climate change, was awarded first place at the Inter-Universities Research and Development Competition organised by the National Universities Commission and hosted by Federal University of Technology, Mina, Niger State, in 2012.\nI feel blessed and privileged to be the first Nigerian to write a play on climate change. I am also humbled by this prestigious award from NUC. A lot of scholars in Nigeria and overseas have used my climate change drama, as a handle to engage their critical lenses on eco-drama and contemporary eco-critical literary studies. But beyond the growing awareness on the subject in the academia, I sincerely wish that Nigeria, as a nation, would give the kind of attention it has given to Boko Haram insurgency to the problem of climate change. I would suggest a Nigerian climate change mitigation and adaptation council, which will comprise experts from diverse fields to proffer lasting solutions on how we can tackle this planetary crisis.\nThere is no national audit on who is doing what work in climate change mitigation and adaptation in Nigeria. The first thing we should have done with ecological fund is conduct a national audit of climate change experts and activists; a comprehensive official directory or who is who among Nigerian authorities in climate change mitigation and adaptation ought to have been produced by now. That way, we get to know who is doing what work in this regard. Such national audit would enable professionals from disparate and diverse fields of studies to interact, interface and network on how to collaborate in tackling the problem of climate change, not only in Nigeria, but Africa in general.\nImagine a forum that integrate social environmentalists, climatologists and others brought together in a two-week retreat in which they would be mandated to fashion out a multi-disciplinary formula for addressing the threat of climate change in the nation? Such a forum can accomplish in two weeks what the climate change office or our national ecological institutions can hardly accomplish in 10 years.\nThe basis for selecting members of this roundtable must be nothing else, but proven excellence or practical results of previous efforts and notable accomplishments in tackling ecological problems in Nigeria. This is a task the climate change office should undertake with an air of urgency.\nGovernment should also commission Nigerian dramatists, musicians, choreographers, dancers, novelists, poets, stand-up comedians and master journalists to produce climate-proof songs, climate-proof Theatre, and radio jingles/slogans. Unless we produce more songs and well-researched plays, the Nigerian populace may remain uninformed and unequipped on what they can do to mitigate and adapt to our changing climate and its devastating consequences.\n\nHow did you harness climate message into a play? \nThe commissioned plays I did for Prof. Charles Soludo and Prof. Eric Eboh at the African Institute for Applied Economists exposed me to experts from different parts of Africa. One of the economists, Dr. Kelvin Urama (Executive Secretary of ATPS, Nairobi, Kenya) took interest in what I did for Soludo's institute, and invited me to write a short play on climate change for an international conference on climate change. After performing this play for ATPS, Nairobi, I developed it into a full-blown drama and got it published in 2011 and 2012. The prize it won shot me to the limelight. Since then, this drama has become a subject of academic interest for eco-critics, scholars and Ph.D students in Nigeria.Interestingly, this play has created more awareness on the threat of climate change than thousands of media reports and theological sermons on the subject.\n\nTheatrical performance is known to be higher in the western part of Nigeria than in any other region. Why is this? \nNaturally, the Yoruba are more theatrical than any other tribe in Nigeria. Theatre is embedded in their everyday life; you find it in their parties, markets, churches, and even in their dressing. Theatre is in their blood and their theatre is all encompassing. In Yoruba theatre, you find dance, music, incantation, orchestration, colour, beauty, exhaustive display of spiritual and cultural affinity and group dynamism at its best.\nThe Igbo, unlike the Yoruba, are extremely business-minded. The Igbo and other southerner tribes generally take life too serious, but for the Yoruba, life is like a chess or ludo game in which both the winners and the losers are jubilant. You can understand why there are more cases of suicidal deaths in Igbo communities? Again, the Yoruba elites are more culturally enlightened and sophisticated than the Igbo elites. How many Igbo politicians can patronise the arts and immerse themselves in the world of artistes the way Bola Ige and many other Yoruba politicians and elites did and are still doing? Ndi Igbo at their best are individuals, while the Yoruba function better in synergy, upholding the spiritism of team play. Igbo think more in terms of commerce and business. For the Yoruba, life is nothing, but a cultural expression. You can now understand why theatre should thrive in their midst. Entertainment is an occasional luxury for Ndi Igbo. They celebrate only during Christmas season, but Yoruba's find reasons to celebrate the joy of living every now and then.\n\nYou are an advocate of solo performance. Do you think this is still relevant, as some people believe ensemble theatre is the way to go because it creates jobs and allows for multiple role casts? \nIt is solo plays that create jobs and not ensemble theatre. Only very few Nollywood stars can achieve what I have accomplished as a solo dramatist. Let me ask you, how many ensemble theatre in the last 10 years have toured Nigerian universities? As a solo dramatist, I have done a nation-wide tour, staging my play in different secondary schools, universities, army barracks and other tertiary institutions numbering over 600 in all, in almost all the cities in Nigeria. Which ensemble group can accomplish that without a sponsor? How many ensemble theatre groups can pay their bills from their earning as actors and actresses? But as a theatrical soloist, I can stand shoulder to shoulder, eyeball to eyeball with the best-paid bankers or oil workers in Nigeria. If ensemble theatre creates a job in the real sense, why have all of them deserted the stage for home video films?\n\nBut solo performance seems restricted in terms of production crew like producers, directors, playwrights and others, isn't this true? \nIf you read our forthcoming book, 50 Years Of Solo Performing Arts In Post-Colonial Nigeria: 1966-2016, you will see that one-man show is not a one-man production. The golden jubilee book edited by G.N.N Mbajiorgu and A.A. Akpuda, addressed this very question. From the multiplicity of voices in the collection, we have demonstrated that the domain of one-man theatre is not an actor-restricted territory. The pioneer exponent of this art in post-colonial Nigeria (Betty Okotie) though an actress of repute, made her debut in the art of one-man theatre as a director not as an actress. Both Benedict Benebai and Akpos Adesi, who are unquestionably fresh bourgeoning exponents of solo drama in Nigeria, are playwrights, not actors.\nThese playwrights have written exciting solo plays for others to perform. Eni Kenneth, too, is neither a soloist nor a mono-dramatist, but he has successfully served as a technical director or set and light designer for different solo productions in Nigeria. Rudoph Kansese has also directed two of Benebai's solo plays and Mbajiorgu's The Prime Minister's Son as well. My co-editor for the forthcoming Golden Jubilee book, Amanze Akpuda, is neither a playwright nor a stage director, but he remains one of the merging critical voices and one of the courageous scholars of this controversial genre of theatre.\nThe fact that solo dramatic art is an actor-centred theatre does not negate the obvious truth that it requires more than the effort of a single artiste to produce. The playwright, directors, set designers, business managers, costume and make-up artists, etcetera, all have a part to play to make it even more vibrant and deeply engaging as a one-actor theatrical form.\n\nWhy do you think most theatre groups are still doing old plays? Is it that they can't perform new ones or are there others mitigating issues?  \nI have no problem if Nigerian directors are producing the classical works of Soyinka, Femi Osofisan, Ola Rotimi, J.P. Clark, Zulu Sofola, Ahmed Yerima, Esiaba Irobi and their likes. After all, we still enjoy the works of William Shakespeare almost 500 years after. My problem is with young playwrights/directors, who have published rather very infantile plays and would insist on producing them every now and then. We mustn't forget that human beings naturally tend to resist change. They like to stick to a world they are already familiar with. Artistes and scholars tend to plough on already cultivated grounds.\nIt is difficult to chart a new course; that is why there are many copycats and a few innovators and original thinkers in the industry. Why is it that I am one of the very few African dramatists engaging serious issues? This is why we are where we are as a nation. Our scholars/artists are too lazy to innovate; we keep sticking unto the same old stuff we are familiar with. I sincerely hope to wake our people up with my forthcoming pro-innovation drama commissioned by the African Innovation Foundation, Switzerland.\n\nSome people are calling for theatre groups to hook on to the screen to make them more visible and popular. How realistic is this? \nHear this, you can screen live theatre, but once it is screened, it is no more live. Screen automatically removes the 'life' in it!\n\nHow best can the masters encourage upcoming ones in the field? \nBy telling them what most textbooks don't tell you about our creative icons. I start my creative working classes with upcoming artists by reminding them that Shakespeare left formal education after secondary school class four, yet he ended up more informed and educated than most of our Ph.D holders. I remind them that Achebe, Soyinka and El Anatsui did not require more than a first degree to become the greatest artists in the African continent with frightening global repute. I remind them that Chimamanda did not necessarily study English literature at university level to become one of the greatest young authors of our continent.\nI also tell them that the father of professional theatre in Nigeria, Hubert Ogunde, did not even have the opportunity of a secondary school education and yet, he could travel to London to import sophisticated theatre equipment that most lecturers in theatre arts cannot afford with their current salaries. I make them know that Achebe wrote Things Fall Apart at a very young age (just 28); that Eneh Henshaw trained as a medical doctor and not as a dramatist and that Femi Osofisan had his first degree in French and not in theatre or dramatic arts, yet he is one of our best dramatists around. You must tell them things that will jolt them up and force them on their toes. That for me is the best way to motivate them and bring the best out of them.\nCopyright  2017 Guardian Newspapers.

Melting ice around the North Pole and increasing snowfall in Siberia reduced the amount of cold air, impeded its southerly route and contributed to the mainland\'s severe air pollution, the team said.\n"The reduced sea ice and increased snowfall have dampened the climatological pressure ridge structure over China," said Professor Yuhang Wang, the report\'s lead scientist and a researcher at the Georgia Tech\'s School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences.\n"That flattens the pressure and temperature gradients and moves the East Asian winter mon-soon to the east, decreasing wind speed and creating an atmospheric circulation that makes the air in China more stagnant," he said.\nThe same weather was repeated earlier this year, with Beijing and many cities in the northern mainland suffering severe winter smog. Low levels of sea ice were recorded in September in the Arctic which was followed by heavy snow in Siberia, both caused by rising average temperatures worldwide.\nThe central government\'s "war on pollution", costing an estimated one trillion yuan (HK$1.13 trillion), has included removing sulph-ur-ous dust from coal chimneys, taking one in five vehicles off the roads, burning natural gas for heating and relocating factories out of cities.\nBut these efforts might be in vain, or take longer to produce the intended result and for more money, because of climate change, the researchers said.\n"Despite efforts to reduce emissions, we think that the haze will probably continue in the future. It is partly climate-driven now, so it probably won\'t get much better in winter.\n"Emissions are no longer the only driver of these conditions," Wang said.\nThe Georgia Tech team is not the first to link Arctic sea ice to the smog on the mainland. Another research team led by Professor Wang Huijun, director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences\' Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP) in Beijing, offered a similar conclusion in 2014 after examining the changes of polar ice and haze.\n"It may not be a politically correct thing to say, but most money spent on smog reduction will produce no effect if Mother Nature does not cooperate," said a researcher with the IAP study, who requested not to be named due to the sensitivity of the topic.\nBut the money must be spent and some efforts must be made, "otherwise people will lose faith and hope in the country", the researcher added.\nZhang Yaocun, a professor at the school of atmospheric sciences at Nanjing University, said it was too early to blame smog on polar ice levels.\n"China and the Arctic is separated by great distance, and the sophisticated mechanism between the interactions of different circulation systems cannot be explained fully by such a simple theory," he said.\n"The tale of smog and Arctic ice has prompted heated debate. Most of the research community remains in doubt.\nCredit: Stephen Chen\n'b'Bonn/Rome - Emissions from the agriculture sectors are set to increase in the future, further contributing to climate change, unless the world adopts sustainable, climate-smart ways of producing, transporting, processing and consuming food, FAO Director-General Jos Graziano da Silva warned today at the United Nations Climate Change conference, COP 23.\n "Climate change puts millions of people in a vicious cycle of food insecurity, malnutrition and poverty. Yet, we must confront the harsh reality: we are not doing enough to deal with this immense threat," Graziano da Silva said. He stressed that Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States are "particularly vulnerable" to climate change.\n Noting that we should "not be discouraged by the challenges ahead," the FAO Director-General stressed that achieving Zero Hunger by 2030 is still possible. "Agriculture is where the fight against hunger and climate change come together to unlock solutions."\n "It is not enough to only transform the way we produce food. Climate change mitigation and adaptation must be integrated into the entire food system: from production to transportation, from processing to food consumption, and in both rural and urban areas," Graziano da Silva said.\n Climate change, hunger and poverty can and must be tackled together\n FAO recently announced that the number of undernourished people has increased for the first time again in a decade with 815 million people going hungry every day.\n This spike is due mainly to conflict and economic downturns, but also the impact of climate change, particularly prolonged droughts in Africa. And estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change show that climate change might increase the risk of hunger and malnutrition by up to 20 percent by 2050.\n Graziano da Silva pointed to the fundamental role of food systems and agriculture which are heavily affected by climate change, but at the same time are also major drivers of climate change.\n Adopting climate-smart agricultural practices\n At least one fifth of total greenhouse gas emission can be attributed to the agriculture sectors, Graziano da Silva noted.\n Much more needs to be done to reduce these emissions and to simultaneously improve yields and build resilience, the FAO Director-General said. This means adopting approaches such as agroecology and sustainable, climate-smart intensification, among others.\n "We cannot expect that smallholders, family farmers and pastoralists ...can tackle these challenges on their own," and they will need national and international support, he added.\n "Reducing deforestation; restoring degraded lands and forests; eliminating food loss and waste; enhancing soil carbon sequestration; low-carbon livestock - these are only a few known solutions to address hunger, poverty and sustainability at the same time," Graziano da Silva explained.\n He noted in particular, that while livestock emits more greenhouse gas than other food sources, "low carbon livestock is possible," - for example, FAO estimates that readily available improved husbandry practices can reduce emissions by 20 to 30 percent.\n FAO\'s work includes supporting countries in sustainably improving their agricultural sectors; in adapting and building resilience, and in mitigating global warming through agriculture. It also assists countries monitor their Nationally Determined Contributions in terms of climate change and delivers the technical and financial support needed to turn these commitments into reality.\n At COP23, FAO launched a new report Tracking Adaptation in Agricultural Sectors that provides a framework and methodology to support to track climate change adaptation measures in the agricultural sectors.\n Source: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n'b"The United Nations' climate chief Patricia Espinosa is no stranger to challenges. As foreign minister of Mexico she presided over the 2010 UN climate change talks in Cancun, bringing countries back to table, rebuilding their confidence in the multilateral process after the failure in Copenhagen the year before. Now, with the United States on the brink of pulling out of the Paris Agreement, Espinosa is facing another challenging moment, this time as the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Urmi A Goswami spoke with the climate diplomat about India's efforts to address climate change, the future of the Paris Agreement and the plan to slow down global warming. Some excerpts:\nThe political changes and the rise of populist inward looking politics, not just in the United States, but in even in Europe does it pose a challenge to the Paris Agreement, especially as countries negotiate the rule-book?  We do have a challenge. Not just for meeting the deadline of finalising the rulebook, but also to meet the goals we set in the Paris Agreement. Achieving these goals is essential for the deep transformation required in our economies and societies. So, we have not set any easy task for ourselves, and we have to be very conscious of that. At the same time, I will say that Paris Agreement has a certain credibility and weight, and there is a general acceptance of its historical importance. This is clearly demonstrated by the fact that governments have ratified the agreement in record time. This is a very complex agreement and we now have 147 countries that have ratified it. This gives a sense of the momentum and political support there is for the agreement. It is at the end of the day a conviction shared by the international community that progressing on the path set out in the Paris Agreement is the way forward.\nThe United States played an important role working with key countries like India and China on the global climate agreement. With the US withdrawing from its leadership, which countries will play the critical role of ensuring the balance achieved in Paris is protected?  There is has been a lot of attention on the role of the main emitters like United States, China, the European Union, and India. These countries are the centre of attention. But in a process like the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the participation of and commitment by each and every country is very important. This is very clear from the fact that even after the United States said it was putting its participation in the agreement under review no other country followed.\nYou led the climate talks in 2010 at an extremely critical juncture for the global effort, and now, you are at the helm of affairs at an equally critical juncture. As UN's climate boss, what is your plan to ensure that the countries stay on course to meet the goal of restricting temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius?  My role now is very different. In Cancun, I was the president of the conference (COP 16) so I had a lot of room to take decisions in the process. This time my role is to be helpful to the COP President that is the Prime Minister of Fiji. I am very conscious of my role of giving him the best possible advice. I will stress on one thing, as I did at that time, the conviction that it is in nobody's interest not to have an agreement. We managed to get the Paris Agreement because countries have realised that it is in their interest, for their development. During my recent visit to India, I learnt how much the government was doing to address climate change. I repeatedly heard that the reason India was taking these measures was to meet its own development goals. The climate agenda is not about meeting international commitments but it relates directly to the everyday lives of people.\nSo this is what I will do, I will see how the different components in the agreement can put together so that we continue to make progress. We need to be mindful that work must progress mitigation action but also on adaptation actions, and on building resilience in our societies. My focus is on finding the right balance. Understand that it is not possible to fully satisfy every country because everyone has a different idea. But if we can get a good mix, then what we have is a set of commitments that is good for everybody.\nWhat are priorities for the year?  This is the first complete session after entry into force of the Paris Agreement. The rule book needs to be completed by 2018. Another important moment in 2018 is the facilitative dialogue that will give us a chance to make an initial assessment of the where we are in respect of the goals we have set collectively.\nThe next milestone moment is the facilitative dialogue in 2018. What is the UNFCCC doing to ensure this stock taking exercise is useful?  The facilitative dialogue is next year. We are supporting the presidency that is Fiji, in gathering the views of the countries on what they expect from the facilitative dialogue and how they expect this exercise to be carried forward. In this process, it is always important to listen to what parties are thinking. This helps us identify an area where we can help the Presidency guide the countries through the process. We are also gathering information about the commitments made by countries so far.\nIn this case also we are also gathering of the information from the commitments that countries have made so far under the convention.\n"b'Amidst the epic devastation of this season\'s hurricanes, many commentators have demanded a renewed discussion of the hazards of climate change. There was an unseemly opportunism in doing this while the damage was still being cleaned up, but we can\'t let the sloganeering go unanswered. The actual event we need to understand is an 11-year absence of landfalling, major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher) followed by a season that is harsh but inside the historical norm. And the human element needing to be discussed is not merely the elusive role greenhousegas (GHG) emissions might play in hurricane formation, but the conspicuous desire of people to live in the path of the storms. \nThe formation of an Atlantic cyclone is a weather event, not a climate event. Hurricanes existed long before humans emitted GHGs. A "climate event" would be a multi-decadal change in their major characteristics. But this has not been observed. According to the U.S. National Hurricane Center, from 1851 to 1960 the U.S. experienced between 15 and 24 landfalling hurricanes per decade, of which between one and 10 were major. From 1960 to 2010 (the period when human GHGs increased sharply) it was 12 to 19 per decade, of which four to seven were major: well within the historical range. It\'s same story if we divide the data at 1970. \nOne recent change is an apparent tendency for fewer landfalling hurricanes. Since 2010 there have only been three, two of which were major. If this season\'s numbers repeat through 2019 the decade may end up just inside the normal range. While people are understandably horrified at the 2017 hurricanes, there is a temptation to extrapolate conclusions from the few that formed while ignoring the many that didn\'t. Looking at the big picture, the role of GHGs, if any, is currently too subtle to identify. \nBut there is one pattern in the data impossible to miss, even though it rarely gets discussed. Postwar U.S. migration patterns show that people seem to prefer the kind of weather that includes hurricane risk. \nAn American can choose just about any climate in which to live, from the Arctic to the tropics, from a rainforest to the desert, and anything in between. We can infer something about peoples\'climatic preferences by looking at where Americans have moved. \nFrom 1950 to 2015 the U.S. population grew at an average rate of 1.2 per cent per year, from 152 million to 321 million. In 1950, the South Atlantic and Gulf states of Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina - the hurricane targets - comprised 12.3 per cent of the U.S. population. For comparison, consider a northern slice covering Massachusetts, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin and Nebraska: states with four seasons and virtually no hurricane risk. This group also comprised 12.3 per cent of the U.S. population in 1950. \nNow fast forward to 2015. The Gulf and South Atlantic states grew two per cent per year, almost double the national average, reaching 21 per cent of the U.S. population. The northern slice, by comparison, grew by only 0.7 per cent per year and fell to 9.3 per cent of the population. Taking the rough with the smooth, a large part of the U.S. population decided it prefers a warmer, wetter and more hazardous climate. In other words, Americans paid money to expose themselves to the worst-case warming scenario. \nThis raises the separate, and thorny, economic issue of disaster relief: If people expect the government to bail them out they will under-insure and over-build in hazard-prone areas. That problem requires addressing, but it is not specifically related to climate change. U.S. migration patterns show that we cannot single out hurricane damages, call it the "costs of not acting on climate change" and demand new policies. First of all, the storms would likely have happened even without man-made GHGs. Second, many of the people who were in the path arrived there after the risk was known, and accepted it as part of a package that also included the benefits of warm weather. They apparently prefer that package to the colder but less hazardous option up north, and would not appreciate costly (not to mention futile) efforts to reverse their choice through new energy taxes and regulations. \nClimate data has a way of upending the simplistic slogans that litter this issue. Historical hurricane records do not reveal a new pattern attributable to GHGs. And market data shows that the so-called social damages of climate change are part of a package of weather conditions perceived as a net benefit by many people experiencing it.\nCredit: Ross Mckitrick; National Post\n'b'ENDANGERED SPECIES\nTo a polar bear, climate change is not a hoax.\nThe chief scientist for Polar Bears International, who lives  north of Kettle Falls, Washington, will be in Spokane on Monday to explain.\nFor centuries, polar bears honed the instincts to survive nearly year-round on sea ice. Unlike grizzly and black bears, polar bear males and nonbreeding females do not hibernate in the winter. They are equipped to tough out some of the harshest weather on the planet as they hunt the pack ice edges and holes primarily for seals.\n"What we\'re seeing is the melting of the seasonal ice ecosystem during summer forcing the bears ashore where they are food-deprived for prolonged periods," said Steven Amstrup of the nonprofit dedicated to the preservation of polar bears and their habitat.\nOn Monday, Amstrup will present a 7 p.m. program at Mountain Gear Headquarters to overview polar bear biology, explain climate change and link the impacts to polar bears and the rest of life on earth.\n"This year we saw the latest return on record of bears to the sea ice," he said, citing data from satellite imagery.\n"Our goal is to save polar bears, but can\'t do that without saving sea ice habitat. They\'re inextricably linked.\n"Since I started studying polar bears in 1980, climate change has turned bear conservation on its head. All the other threats to polar bears pale by comparison to global warming and the need for stopping greenhouse gas rise.\n"For many years, polar bear research and conservation was about balancing harvest with what populations could sustain, just as deer and elk are managed. Polar bears are a renewable resource if there\'s good management and habitat."\nHunting may become an issue again as sea ice habitat continues to decline.\n"Hunting may be faced with quotas as the habitat is able to support fewer and fewer bears."\nThe loss of sea ice magnifies other impacts, he said, including oil and gas development, human activities and oil spills.\n"When these bears come in contact with human activity, we usually end up with dead bears," Amstrup said.\nAmstrup, 67, earned degrees at the universities of Washington, Idaho and Alaska. He led polar bear ecology research in Alaska for 30 years with the U. S. Geological Survey before retiring in 2010.\nHe\'s headed polar bear science groups, published peer-reviewed articles and, in 2007, he led a USGS research team\'s production of nine reports that convinced the U.S. Interior secretary that polar bears should be declared a threatened species.\nIn the December 2010 issue of Nature, Amstrup and his coauthors showed the relationship between global temperature and sea ice.\nPreserving polar bears requires a halt to man-caused temperature increase, the scientists said.\nIn 2012, Amstrup was honored with the Indianapolis Prize, billed as the world\'s leading award for animal conservation.\nHe said that polar bears are merely the tip of the iceberg among the wildlife that will be impacted by climate change.\n"If we act in time to save polar bears, we will benefit most of the rest of life on earth," he said.\n"I\'ve devoted my life to this. We already know the answer to questions on what we need to do to save polar bears. Now its time to focus on conservation and getting people to change their ways."\nCLIMATE CHANGE EFFECTS\nPolar bear scientist Steven Amstrup will present a free program, "Polar Bears and Climate Change," on Monday at 7 p.m. at Mountain Gear Corporate Headquarters, 6021 E.

It\'s almost impossible to blame any individual climate or weather event entirely on global warming, when there are so many complex physical factors that may cause them to occur. But scientists are getting better at figuring out to what extent climate change may have increased the probability or the severity of any given event. \nNow, a group of scientists has extended this field of research to a global scale. In a new study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they\'ve analysed the influence of global warming on extreme climate events all over the world. And they\'ve found that climate change has had a substantial effect. \nThe study suggests that anthropogenic global warming, as it\'s advanced, has had a significant hand in the temperatures seen during the hottest month and on the hottest day on record throughout much of the world. It finds that climate change substantially increased the likelihood of these record warm events occurring in the first place, and made them more severe than they otherwise would have been, in more than 80% of the observed world. \n"This suggests that the world isn\'t yet at a place where every single record-setting hot event has a human fingerprint, but we are getting close to that point," said Noah Diffenbaugh, a climate scientist at Stanford University and lead author. "Greater than 80% of those record hot events is a substantial fraction." \nThe study also finds that climate change increased the probability and severity of the driest year on record - that is, the year that experienced the least precipitation - in 57% of the observed areas of the world. And it found the wettest five-day period in each of these areas, or the five-day period with the most precipitation on record, warming had increased the chance of its occurring in 41% of the observed areas of the world. \nSome of the strongest effects of climate change on these extremes were seen in the tropics, a stark reminder that "a lot of the burden for climate change falls on regions that have emitted only a tiny fraction of the CO2 that caused the shifts", said Gabriele Hegerl, a climate scientist at the University of Edinburgh and co-leader of a World Climate Research Programme project focusing on weather and climate extremes. (Hegerl was not involved with the new study.) \nFinally, the study suggests global warming contributed substantially to a record low in Arctic sea ice extent in 2012, as well. \n"There\'s been an explosion of research into possible connections between global warming and individual extreme climate events," said Diffenbaugh. \nTo date, much of this type of research has been in the form of case studies on individual events, Diffenbaugh noted. But in the new paper, he and his colleagues analysed a variety of different types of climate extremes all across the world using different approaches designed to investigate the influence of global warming. \nOne approach, for instance, involves simply looking at the observational record to see whether historical climate trends have influenced the probability or severity of certain types of events over time, Diffenbaugh noted. Another approach involves using models to compare scenarios that include human-caused climate change with scenarios in which the climate remains static to see if the occurrence of extreme events is different between them. \nThe new paper includes several variations of these types of approaches, including historical observations and model-based strategies. The researchers applied these techniques to four different categories of extreme events, which were "unprecedented in the historical record", said Diffenbaugh. \nThese included the hottest month, hottest day, the driest year on record and wettest five-day period on record. Data on these extremes is not uniformly available all around the world, but the researchers analysed the areas for which information was available. \nThe researchers looked at historical trends in temperature and precipitation, as well as comparisons between different models scenarios - with and without the influence of human-caused climate change - to draw conclusions about how global warming has affected long-term climate patterns, and how these trends have affected the likelihood or magnitude of an extreme event. \nThe researchers later applied the same framework to the Arctic sea ice record to quantify the influence of global warming on the 2012 record-low extent. \nAnd, said Diffenbaugh, the framework can also be applied to certain specific physical conditions - atmospheric patterns, for instance - that help make an extreme event, like a storm or a heat wave, possible in the first place. \nIn the future, this strategy could become an important way to improve projections of certain types of extreme weather events under different climate scenarios, by analysing the likelihood of specific conditions and patterns that could combine to give rise to different weather outcomes. \nOverall, the researchers\' approach is a "step forward" from the types of individual case studies that have been done in the past, said climate scientist Adam Sobel, director of Columbia University\'s Initiative on Extreme Weather and Climate, who was not involved with the new research. \nThe strategy "allows general statements about what fraction of events of the given types selected have a statistically significant anthropogenic influence subject to the assumptions", he said. \nHe added that the findings linking extreme temperature events to global warming in so many places are not exactly surprising. \nWhat\'s more interesting, he said, are the physical processes that have made these extremes possible in the first place - that is, the idea that the temperature signal here is found to be due not just to simple global warming, but to "changes in the frequency of atmospheric patterns". \nThis reinforces the importance of looking not just at whole events, like heat waves or floods, but at their complex, underlying physical causes - and to what extent these causes may be affected by climate change. \nAs it is, the new study focuses only on climate change and extreme events that have already occurred since the preindustrial era. But Diffenbaugh points out that the same framework could be used to make predictions about the future climate. - Washington Post\n'b'Members of the Cape Town Climate Change Coalition, ladies and gentlemen. \nIt is a great pleasure to join like-minded people and organisations who are committed to responding to climate change in our city. \nThe impact of climate change has the ability to compound existing challenges in urban environments. \nFor this reason, the City of Cape Town is overlaying all our decisions that we make on a daily basis with the impacts of climate change. \nWe cannot plan anything without factoring in the impact of climate change. \nClimate change is a challenge increasingly being tackled by mayors around the world. \nThe former New York mayor, Michael Bloomberg, said: "Climate change may be the most complicated challenge of our time" and in his new book, Climate of Hope, he deals with how we can solve it. \nBloomberg says we can do this not by slowing down economies, but by speeding them up; not by depending on national governments, but by empowering cities, businesses and residents; not by scaring people about the future, but by showing them the immediate benefits of taking action. \nWe are not waiting for national governments and large corporations to act. \nWe are responsible for the growth and well-being of our local economies and our residents. \nWe therefore need to see the opportunities presented by climate change and factor in our response to climate change in all the work we do so that we can build more resilient cities. \nSince I last addressed the Climate Change Coalition, I can report on several new initiatives in the city. \nWe have a new draft Climate Change Policy, which is our first dedicated climate change response policy. \nThe draft Climate Change Policy is a new approach for the City of Cape Town. \nPreviously, consideration of climate change issues fell under a more general environmental policy. \nHowever, it has been recognised that climate change is such an important, cross-cutting and consequential issue that it requires its own dedicated policy approach. \nThis policy highlights the importance of recognising the economic and social dimensions of climate change, in addition to the environmental consequences, and working towards implementing responses to climate change that address these economic and social issues. \nThe draft Climate Change Policy focuses on both climate change mitigation and adaptation, and aims to address these both in an integrated and innovative way. \nThe policy went out for public participation in November and December. \nMore than 750 comments were received through the process, and many of these provided useful insights that allowed us to improve the policy. I would like to thank those of you here tonight who contributed your comments and suggestions. \nIt is expected that this policy will be formally adopted by the council as soon as possible. \nCape Town is a member of the C40 Climate Leadership Group (a network of more than \n90 cities working to reduce carbon emissions and climate risks) and a signatory of the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy. \nAs such, the city is committed to reporting its energy and climate data to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) annually. \nLast year, Cape Town was named one of the top five reporting cities out of the 533 participating cities globally. \nThe City\'s Energy2040 Goal, which models a more resilient, resource-efficient and equitable future for Cape Town, commits the city to diversifying Cape Town\'s energy supply and reducing carbon emissions. \nCentral to this will be the ability to source 20% of Cape Town\'s energy from renewable sources by 2020. \nThis requires a significant shift in the city\'s approach and control over energy supply sources. \nTo put the necessary new emphasis on energy generation, the city has established a new Directorate of Energy through our Organisational Development and Transformation Plan (ODTP). \nThis change is in line with our ODTP transformational priorities to position Cape Town as a forward-looking, innovative, globally competitive business city and to enhance resource-efficiency and security. \nThis directorate has been tasked with transforming the energy landscape in Cape Town, where we will no longer merely just be distributors of electricity but we will also generate our own clean energy. \nWe want Capetonians to have a greater choice over how they consume energy and the price they pay for it. \nWe intend to contract with independent power producers (IPPs) of renewable energy and will pursue this relentlessly, using all available means with national government to ensure it is achieved. \nI have said previously that we are going to take the Minister of Energy to court to fight for our right to purchase renewable energy directly from IPPs. We have briefed the best legal counsel in the country, led by advocate Wim Trengrove SC, to get clarity on the best way forward in terms of claiming our right to purchase electricity from whom we so choose. \nThis will be a complex legal battle but it must be understood that we are doing this not just because we want to buy electricity from IPPs, but because we believe that the whole institutional regime governing energy in the country is completely outdated and needs to be reformed. \nHopefully, with the City of Cape Town taking on this legal battle, it will be the start of just such a reform. And we will promote the responsible installation of grid-tied small-scale embedded generation, particularly in the form of rooftop PV panels. \nAt this time, contracts have been signed with more than 80 commercial and industrial customers and 196 residential customers who are able to feed into the city\'s grid. \nBoth the large-scale cleaner energy supply and the small-scale embedded generation projects I have just mentioned are included in the draft Integrated Development Plan (IDP) for 2017-2022. \nCape Town has also made substantial gains in energy efficiency and now, relative to other South African cities, uses significantly less electricity per unit of production and per person. \nThe electricity saving campaigns for both the commercial and residential sectors has been very successful in promoting energy efficiency and since 2009, the city has been leading by example by implementing energy efficiency retrofit programmes within municipal operations. \nSome examples include the fact that all 1 500 traffic lights now have efficient LED bulbs and more than 25 000 street lights have been retrofitted. \nThe lighting retrofitting of the city\'s main administrative building, the Civic Centre, has been completed where 20 000 light fittings have been upgraded to LED technology, with occupancy sensors linked to timers and daylight harvesting. \nThe payback period is less than three years, and the electricity demand saving of 1.2 Megawatts will save an additional R6 million in the first year and more than R36m over the next five years. \nThe city has also included a specific climate adaptation response in the 2017-2022 industrial development plan. \nThe climate adaptation plan is intended to build resilience and adapt to the projected impacts of climate change, many of which are already being felt. \nClimate change will have significant impacts on the availability of water in our city, and the current drought provides us with the perfect opportunity to focus on our minds on the appropriate responses, to ensure that we can maintain the health and well-being our people and our economy. \nThere are immediate interventions that are being undertaken to respond to the drought crisis. \nWe simply have to save water while there is still water to be saved. \nCouncillor Xanthea Limberg will elaborate on the various efforts under way later on. \nWe are reviewing our 30-year water plan to give greater consideration to climate change so that we can to see a shift where Cape Town will become a water-sensitive city. \nThis concept means managing all urban water (stormwater, groundwater, rivers and treated wastewater effluent) in an integrated way, with the ultimate aim of being able to use these as sources of drinking water. \nI will also be inviting a water expert, Mr Leslie Darling from the Chicago Infrastructure Trust, to visit the City of Cape Town to share best practice solutions with our Water and Sanitation Management Department. \nWe will also be meeting with the business community in the next few weeks to engage with them on some of their water supply and conservation ideas because we realise that again in this time of crisis, there are many opportunities to be tapped into. \nWe fundamentally have the opportunity to improve resource efficiencies in our local economy, whether it is water, energy, waste or biodiversity. \nOur provincial government has also asked me to briefly share with you some of its initiatives aimed at tackling climate change, such as the Western Cape Climate Change Response Strategy and SmartAGri Implementation Plan. \nIn recognising that the Western Cape is already a water-stressed province, in 2014 the Western Cape government launched the Western Cape Climate Change Response Strategy, which is a co-ordinated climate change response and will guide the collective implementation of innovative projects - as well as the search for opportunities that combine a low-carbon development trajectory with increased climate resilience, enhancement of ecosystems and the services they provide, as well as economic growth and job creation. \nThe focus of the strategy is on pragmatic approaches to be implemented locally in an integrated way. \nThe strategy includes a number of focus areas and priority programmes that include water security and management, food security, healthy communities, and biodiversity ecosystem goods and services, which all have strong linkages with our water resources. \nA core focus of the strategy was the main-streaming of climate change responses into sectoral functions and operations. \nThe SmartAgri Implementation Plan launched in 2016 was the first climate-change response sector plan developed in the Western Cape \nSmartAgri is a partnership project between the departments of Agriculture and Environmental Affairs and Development, which is a roadmap for actionable and prioritised initiatives that will take the agricultural sector towards greater resilience in the face of climate challenges. \nI was recently invited to become a member of the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, which is an initiative aimed at exploring how countries can achieve economic growth while dealing with the risks of climate change. \nWith the former president of Mexico and the former Nigerian minister of finance as the chairman and co-chairman respectively, I share a commissioner role along with the former mayor of Rio and various members from the global academic sector and the private sector. \nAmong other things, this initiative has a strong emphasis on encouraging compact, connected and co-ordinated development, which aligns well with the new strategic priority of the city of working to achieve dense and transit-oriented growth and development. \nConsiderable work is planned by the city in this area over the next five years, all of which will contribute to both mitigating and adapting to climate change. \nThrough the Global Commission, I intend to both share some of the successes in Cape Town on responding to climate change, but also to critically engage with other government leaders about how to seek economic opportunities in responding to climate change. \nThank you for your commitment to responding to climate change in general, and to the drought crisis in particular. \nI look forward to hearing more about what our partners and members of the business community are doing this evening. \nThe speech was delivered by Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille at the Climate Change Coalition meeting on Tuesday\n'b'Some places in New Zealand may not even be able to get insurance due to the effects of climate change, writes Leith Huffadine .\nClimate change is not only set to transform our environment, it\'s also likely to cause insurance costs to skyrocket.\nThe Insurance Council of New Zealand has warned that our country is one of the most vulnerable to the impact of natural disasters for an economy of our size.\nCouncil chief executive Tim Grafton says New Zealand can expect to face, on average, annual costs of $1.6 billion (just under 1 per cent of its GDP) from natural disasters, based on data going back to 1900.\nWithout risk reduction, that cost will increase, he says.\nBryce Davies is the general manager of corporate relations at IAG, whose insurance brands include State and AMI. His job involves sustainability and corporate responsibility, government relations at central and local levels, and he is preparing for the impact of climate change.\nHe\'s part of the government\'s climate change adaptation technical working group. The group comprises a range of experts including engineers, climate scientists, Maori leaders, farmers and business people. Its purpose is to help New Zealand prepare for climate change.\nDavies is acutely aware of the key role that insurers hold in the future of climate change and adaption in New Zealand.\nThere\'s a big focus on the impacts of climate change-related sea level rise. However, there are other climate related issues that will impact insurance, like flooding.\nWhere will the insurance costs hit?\nHawke\'s Bay areas including Haumoana are the most obvious examples of insurance cost rises related to climate change, Davies says.\nLow-lying areas around Napier are at risk. A large chunk of the Hauraki Plains lie below sea level. They\'re at risk as well, according to Davies.\nIn the wider Auckland area, Helensville, Mission Bay and Kohimarama are on the list. Parts of Wellington are under threat.\nIn the South Island, South Dunedin and the Taieri Plains could be impacted. Areas of Christchurch area under threat, too.\nAnd that\'s just considering areas affected by sea level rise. "There are tonnes."\nThere is still a lot of work to be done for everyone to understand which areas are at risk, Davies says.\nLegal liability, insurance and the risks of climate change\nCatherine Lorns, from the Law Faculty at Victoria University of Wellington, is investigating sea level rise and climate change.\nShe\'s looking into "tipping points" for when insurance companies might stop insuring coastal property owners - and what would happen after that.\nAnother aspect is investigating how much people can rely on the EQC or central government for compensation after being affected by coastal climate change-related incidents.\nWhat are the insurance options in at-risk areas?\nSo far, it\'s a bit theoretical and based on "insurance 101", according to Davies.\n"Insurance works by taking what you would expect to have lost and sharing the cost of that across a whole bunch of people," the IAG general manager of corporate relations says.\nIt\'s called pooling, and losses are pooled over geography and over time.\n"Rather than you having to deal with the fact that your [home] burned down, we spread the cost of that."\nIt makes it more affordable for everyone and means high-risk locations are subsidised by low- risk areas It\'s called community rating.\nThe other way is to make people pay for the risks they have and the losses they\'re likely to incur. The higher risk the location, the more you pay. That\'s risk-based pricing.\n"We take physical impacts and turn them into economic impacts. That\'s how we price."\nInsurers in New Zealand err on the side of community rating. They could continue community rating high-risk locations based on the theory it was better for New Zealand they were insured and could afford to recover, according to Davies. Or decide it was better for them to understand the risk and make them pay their fair share.\n"The reality is, we are heading more towards risk-based pricing," Davies says.\nThe risks would keep getting worse for some areas.\n"[Insurers] cover risks, not certainties. So if it\'s almost certain you are going to be flooded, then that\'s not the business we are in."\nMore risk equals higher cost. Eventually, insurance wouldn\'t be provided.\nIs insurance already changing for some places?\nThere are a small number of locations where it has.\n"We\'ve mentioned Haumoana. That\'s an obvious one. Because waves go into homes on the foreshore," Davies says.\n"For various reasons, Taihape is another interesting one. That\'s a landslide issue.\n"It\'s actually exceptionally rare that we don\'t insure people in New Zealand. Some people pay a bit more. Some people have higher excesses but by and large, most people get the same product.\n"We\'re kind of at the early point of a phase where that\'s likely to change for some locations. Are there huge examples of it? No, because we haven\'t really had to do that yet."\nBut it\'s on its way.\nWhile there are some areas where risk-based pricing already exists, other factors may also play a part - not just climate change. Earthquakes are the main cause.\nDavies says IAG looks at two main categories of threats. One is the physical impacts likely to become more frequent and more intense. It\'s keeping a "beady eye" on those.\nBut it\'s focusing more on the social and economic consequences for households and businesses.\nDavies thinks New Zealand doesn\'t have a good handle on those yet.\nIs climate change already having an impact on the insurance industry?\nYes, but it\'s hard to say how much, according to Davies.\n"Everyone is trying to get a handle on it, so there\'s no real definitive answer," he says.\n"We can see in the money we pay out... the costs are going up. It\'s becoming more expensive. And it will only become more so.\n"For us, climate change is just exacerbating the risks we already had."\nIn short, it\'s too early to say.\nIt\'s a big issue and insurers have to consider a few other things.\nEarthquakes, for example.\nCompetition, international expectations about managing the money of re-insurers, and the fact most are listed entities and have to return dividends to shareholders are some.\nOn the other hand are customer expectations and a moral obligation to help keep people insured.\n"That\'s our job. We are here to insure people. So we\'re not doing our job very well if we start saying no," Davies says.\n"If we start saying no to people, that we are not wanting to insure a particular location... the banks are quite interested in that."\nBanks consider the security of their lending. They also rely on homes being insured so they can recover - if needed - the money home owners borrowed.\nThe same applied for business lending.\n"If we say no, [banks] are probably going to say no," Davies says.\n"Now, if banks do that, what is that going to do to a community? If we get this wrong and communities don\'t start to adapt, there\'s some really big consequences."\nIf insurers wont insure and banks won\'t lend, there\'s a harsh outcome.\n"That community can\'t be there anymore... That\'s really the consquence."\nInsurers will have to work with local and central government - and communities - to keep the communities safe.\nInsurance industry\'s position\nDavies believesthe insurance industry has a unique position in terms of dealing with climate change, and a lot of responsibility.\n"We have a purpose as a company - to make the world a safer place - and helping communities be safe in the face of the impacts of climate change and other natural hazards," he says. "That\'s the most obvious way we can live out that purpose.\nIn a way, the insurance industry holds a starting gun, Davies says.\n""Through the price we charge, through the decisions we make about [who has cover], we are telling people about the risks they are facing and whether they should be there or [not]," he says.\n"We signal the risk. Overall, what we want people to do is make better decisions about risk."\nHe believes the insurance industry needs to set parameters so that the country takes the right steps to deal with the issue.\nInsurance \'must remain affordable\'\nThe Insurance Council of New Zealand has warned that insurance "must remain available and affordable for everyone otherwise individuals, business, local and central government will end up bearing the brunt of the costs".\nIt has recommended 15 steps to protect the country from natural hazards. They\'re grouped in four areas: strategy and legislation, information to make the right decisions, funding and insurance.\nThe insurance section has one step: "Keep insurance affordable and available for all - introduce comprehensive measures to reduce the risk of natural disasters and remove levies from insurance premiums to help keep the transfer of risk to insurance affordable."\nAssessing the way forward\nThere\'s a fair bit of research happening in New Zealand focusing on climate change and insurance.\nThe Deep South National Science Challenge\'s objective is to understand the role of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean in determining our climate and our future environment. One of its projects is looking into climate and insurance.\nThe Challenge says high insurance premiums or unavailable insurance have a stronger impact than uncertain events in the future on how private decisions are made.\n"Escalating coastal hazards don\'t seem to be reflected in home- owners\' decisions to purchase and renovate coastal property, and further, climate risk is likely not currently incorporated into the price of residential coastal property."\nEvidence suggests high insurance premiums or unavailability of insurance has a stronger impact on private decision.\nThe economic implications of insurance retreat\nDespite the risks associated with climate change, demand for coastal housing has increased, the Deep South Challenge notes.\nSo has new and intensified development of existing urban coastal areas.\nBelinda Storey, Managing Director of Climate Sigma, is investigating how coastal housing markets might respond to "insurance retreat" - what will happen if insurance becomes unavailable.\nStorey says the areas affected first by sea level rise will be those with small tidal ranges - that\'s the difference between low and high tides.\n"The smaller your tidal range the more exposed you are to a storm surge, because there is a bigger chance that the storm surge will be bigger than the tidal range."\nThat means, for example, Wellington and Christchurch will be affected sooner than Auckland.\nWhen hazards start to affect access to insurance depends on insurance thresholds, Storey says.\nEarly research suggests that will be once the probability of a devastating hazard reaches a one in fifty year event.\n"Once it reaches a one in 20 year event it is likely that you will be unable to find an insurance company that will renew your policy."\nThe Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment has shown that with 10 centimetres of sea level rise, a location currently exposed to costal inundation once every century will be exposed once every 22 years.\nPoint where insurance is not available\nWith a 10cm rise, we\'re likely to hit a point where insurance isn\'t available. And that 10cm rise will happen in the next 20 years.\nIt\'s also "locked in".\nAny steps to minimise climate change and emissions might slow down sea level rise, but that 10cm rise is going to happen.\nA report on the issue states: "... global average sea levels will likely rise by between 44cm and 55cm by 2100, and around 1 metre with continued high emissions.\n"Across New Zealand... there are 43,683 homes within 1.5m of the present average spring high tide and 8806 homes within 50cm."\nStorey says the costs of living in coastal areas - repairs and mitigation for example - will go up and the relative value of those properties will fall.\nShe\'s also found insurance availability is a stronger factor in property value than sea level rise.\nThe water could be at your back step, so to speak, but if you still have insurance, you wouldn\'t notice as severe a drop in value.\nThese are likelihoods. realities at some point. Not possibilities.\nPeople don\'t want to talk about it\n"Insurance policies are for, say, 12 months at a time. So you don\'t know you are no longer able to get insurance until you go your insurer and they say \'I\'m sorry, we\'re not going to renew your policy\'," Storey says.\n"But they may have a mortgage on that property for another 20 years. If you find yourself [that] you\'ve lost insurance, you\'re not going to want to tell people about that because it undermines your ability to sell that property because whoever is buying it won\'t be able to get a mortgage.\n"You can\'t get a mortgage in New Zealand if you can\'t get insurance."\nThe risk faced is accelerating and it\'s possible that awareness isn\'t keeping up, Storey says.\nBut a dramatic or severe event could shock people into understanding.\nStorey says people should know coastal property has limited time left.\nPeople have been buying and selling it, expecting permanent ownership.\n"Once you realise that it\'s got this time limit on it, this lease with nature, I think that will shift people\'s thinking."\nAnother part of the Deep South Challenge is investigating who should bear the responsibility of risk in terms of sea level rise. Individuals? Insurance companies? Or local and central government?\nExtreme weather, climate change & the EQC\nWhile the Earthquake Commission mainly aids those affected by earthquakes, homeowners can also make EQC claims for some damage from extreme weather like storms, floods or landslips.\nThe Deep South Challenge notes that "more frequent and more intense weather can therefore affect the EQC\'s long- term sustainability".\nThe EQC manages the National Disaster Fund - which is built by levies paid when people insure their homes and contents - you automatically have EQCover if you have this. The EQC will usually pay the first $100,000 for damage to a home, up to $20,000 for contents and cover storm and flood damage to homes.\nAn example of how the fund could be exhausted is the Christchurch and Kaikoura earthquakes. The fund was at $6.1 billion in 2010. Paying out for the quakes may use up all of it.\nOver the last 20 years, the EQC has paid out over $240 million, on more than 17,000 claims, to households affected by non- earthquake disasters, according to the Deep South Challenge.\nDeep South research will look into how the EQC has covered households after extreme weather events, if insurance pay-outs have supported households and communities to recover economically, and what the EQC\'s future, given climate change projections about extreme weather.\nThe motu report on insurance, housing and climate change\nAn all-encompassing report on the issue by Motu Economic and Public Policy Research, a non- profit economic and public policy research institute, assesses the situation.\nIt is blunt. A single sentence in the report sums up the reality.\n"Climate change will render some currently inhabited locations uninhabitable".\nCAPTION:\nThe coast along Carters Beach, near Westport, is rapidly eroding in the face of sea level rise and more damaging weather events.\nFlooding in Edgecumbe, in the Bay of Plenty, earlier in 2017. Extreme events related to climate change are likely to become more frequent - and bring with them more insurance claims.\n'b'During Tuesdays climate talks in Bonn, Germany, Syria announced its decision to sign the Paris agreement on climate change. Syrias entry into the Paris climate accord follows Nicaragua signing the agreement last month, leaving the United States as the only country opting out of the global consensus on climate action.\nI would like to affirm the Syrian Arab Republics commitment to the Paris climate change accord, Syrian Deputy Environment Minister Wadah Katmawi told delegates in Bonn, adding that Syria would seek foreign aid to meet its commitments under the deal.\nThe Paris climate agreement is a global initiative to stop temperatures from rising more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, a threshold above which dangerous changes to the climate are likely irreversible. It allows countries to determine their own course of action to reduce emissions.\nNicaragua held off on entering the initiative because leaders claimed it did not go far enough to contain climate change. Syria was engaged in an ongoing civil war since 2011; because of European and American sanctions, the country could not send representatives abroad to negotiate or sign the pact.\nPresident Donald Trump announced in June his decision to withdraw from the climate accord.\nWere getting out, he said. And we will start to renegotiate and well see if theres a better deal. If we can, great. If we cant, thats fine.\nFor the time being Trump is not invited to the climate change summit hosted in Paris, the Elysee Palace told CNN. Invitations are first sent to five countries that display active engagement.\nSyria Joins Paris Climate Accord, Leaving US as Last Country Opposed\nCredit: Davis Richardson\n'b'As conditions push players to the limit, the worlds poor are living on the edge, says Peter Boyer\nHOW much heat and humidity should halt tennis matches? When temperatures pass 40C should cricketers take to the field, or should bike racing be cancelled?\nTheres a question of fairness at play in this. Grizzled players from times past talk of softness creeping into the game, as if thats all that needs to be said. But it isnt.\nImperceptibly but irresistibly, conditions are changing.\nThe heatwaves of today are stronger than they once were, and todays young people are being asked to perform in conditions that will soon be pushing against the limits of human health. Questions about the dangers of active sport in summer heat are becoming common.\nThe death of an athlete from heatstroke in one of our big sporting events would put another kind of heat on event authorities, so they are putting a lot of money and effort into trying to stop it happening.\nI dont know how this will play out. Cricket and tennis matches are perhaps most manageable in that players can cool off during breaks in play.\nEndurance events on land, such as running and cycling, may eventually have to be moved to cooler seasons or relocated to Tasmania.\nUnlike elite sports, the worlds poor have no resources to draw on to relieve their discomfort. But they are or will become the real victims of extreme heat and other outcomes of climate change that include drought and flood, crop and fishing failures and rising seas inundating coastal lands.\nIronically, these developments can be sheeted home to greenhouse emissions mainly from activities by wealthier countries and their people  one of the glaring injustices that have been exercising some of the worlds best ethical and legal minds.\nThe people of Hobart have the opportunity to hear outcomes of such contemplation in a public conference next month titled Imagining a different future: Overcoming barriers to climate justice.\nWhen you think about it, questions of justice, or fairness, creep into pretty well everything we are faced with in dealing with human-induced climate change.\nIs it fair, for instance, that a whole generation of lawmakers in our parliaments has ignored the imperative to prepare infrastructure, governance and economic resources to deal with the predictable stresses that climate change will impose on future generations?\nIs it fair that when, more than ever, we need considered decisions and stable institutions supported explicitly and implicitly by the public at large, key players seem to have decided that anything goes in public life?\nIs it fair that the same governments that are putting ever more resources into policing the behaviour of individuals are handing over power to private interests responsible to no-one except their shareholders, while denouncing the red tape that allows us to scrutinise and regulate them?\nThe populism that pervades politics today has brought to the fore questions about the capacity for independent thought among those in authority. We need more than ever politicians and bureaucrats with knowledge and imagination, able to think outside the square.\nWith an election coming up to decide Tasmanias government for the next four years, there could not be a better time to bring the best and brightest thinkers on justice and ethics to Hobart to challenge assumptions and pose the questions that politicians and the rest of us need to be asking.\nImagining will be looking at the many barriers that stop necessary changes from happening in government, law, business, economics and energy, and how we utilise science and technology. And beneath all this, the psychology behind our responses to climate change.\nEthical issues affecting disadvantaged countries, divestment, technological interventions and human rights and climate-change litigation are all being examined at the conference, which will also involve the work of artists, writers, filmmakers, and musicians engaging with climate change.\nAugmenting Australian thinkers, lawyers and scientists at the conference will be international luminaries including Marcus Duwell, a European ethicist, Catriona McKinnon, a British specialist in political theory and expert in the law and politics of climate change and Steve Vanderheiden, an acclaimed American expert writer on climate ethics and environmental politics.\nThe University of Tasmania is to be congratulated for giving its strong backing to the conference and community events and for supporting the Law Schools legal academics Peter Lawrence and Jan Linehan in their outstanding effort to get it happening.\nFor funding a community event in which ordinary Tasmanians can have their say at the end of the conference, to be led by 2017 Senior Tasmanian of the Year Margaret Steadman, the Hodgman government gets a pat on the back. It would make eminent sense if some in its ranks took part.\nImagining a different future is open to the public from February 8-10 in the Medical Science Precinct, corner of Liverpool and Campbell streets. Register at www.climatejustice.network.\nThere are two free public events. Steve Vanderheiden will speak about climate ethics at 7.30pm on February 8 at Hobart Town Hall and a forum at the Medical Science Precinct on February 10 from 1pm- 5pm invites Tasmanians to explore how climate justice might improve our future.\nPeter Boyer, who began his journalism career at the Mercury, specialises in the science and politics of climate change.\nCREDIT: Peter Boyer\n'b'The Trump administration\'s withdrawal from the Paris agreement heralds a decisive change in U.S. climate policy, but many corporate leaders say it will have little immediate impact on their investments and strategies.\nPresident Donald Trump said the U.S. will begin negotiations to either re-enter the accord or start a new deal on "terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers."\nSome mining companies, including Murray Energy Corp., the country\'s largest privately held coal miner, hailed the decision, saying the climate rules would have threatened jobs and economic growth.\nBut a number of major corporations and chief executives expressed disappointment in the move, including Dow Chemical Co. and Microsoft Corp. as well as the heads of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\'s Google.\n"Today\'s decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.\'s leadership position in the world," Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said in his first tweet ever.\nMany large companies said they wouldn\'t change course, and their reasons are diverse. Companies are responding to customer and shareholder demands to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Many operate in states and countries that are putting in place climate rules and thus face pressures beyond the U.S. government.\nFirms are buying natural gas and renewable electricity that emit less pollutants because they are becoming cheaper. And many are making long-term capital investments to reduce their carbon footprints with an eye toward future decades, not the current election cycle.\nExxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S. oil producer, has said it wants a consistent set of rules, and favors remaining in the Paris Agreement. "We need a framework like that to address the challenge of climate change and the risk of climate change," Chief Executive Darren Woods said at the company\'s annual meeting on Wednesday, where 62% of shareholders voted for a resolution to pressure Exxon to share more information about how climate change could affect its business.\nGeneral Electric Co. has spent billions to make technologies that reduce energy consumption a core part of its business. "Disappointed with today\'s decision on the Paris Agreement," GE Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt said via Twitter. "Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government."\nFord Motor Co. said it was still committed to technology investments to make its vehicles emit less carbon dioxide, including shorter-term moves to improve the efficiency of the internal combustion engine, and longer-term plans to develop affordable fuel cells and enhanced batteries to create electric vehicles that can travel longer. Much of the auto industry is on a similar course.\nSome companies support leaving the agreement because they see it as a way to jump-start industries weighed down by environmental regulations. Murray Energy\'s controlling owner, Robert Murray, has been a strong backer of Mr. Trump. "In following through on his promise, President Trump is supporting America\'s uncompromising values, saving coal jobs, and promoting low-cost, reliable electricity for Americans and the rest of the world," he said.\nPeabody Energy Corp., a coal producer in St. Louis, supported the decision. "We believe that abiding by the accord, without significant changes, would have substantially impacted the U.S. economy, increased electricity costs and required the power sector to rely on less diverse and more intermittent energy."\nAdam Green, an analyst for World Steel Dynamics, a steel-industry consulting firm, said Mr. Trump\'s decision won\'t immediately affect the industry, but "it lifts some of the veiled uncertainty" about the cost of complying with future regulations.\nU.S. energy-related carbon emissions are at their lowest level since 1992, according to federal statistics. This is mostly because the U.S. electricity system has replaced a large amount of coal-fired power with natural gas and renewables.\nAmerican Electric Power Co., one of the largest utility companies in the U.S., has been shifting toward more gas, wind and solar because the moves are popular with customers and provide increasingly inexpensive power, said Chief Executive Nick Akins. He said it was a mistake for the U.S. to exit from the agreement.\n---\nThomas Gryta, Bradley Olson, Timothy Puko and Bob Tita contributed to this article.\nCredit: By Russell Gold and Lynn Cook\n'b'General Electric Co. CEO Jeffrey Immelt defended efforts to reduce emissions and fight climate change, after President Donald Trump reversed rules  that pushed U.S. utilities to use cleaner-burning fuels.\nIn a blog post to employees Wednesday, Mr. Immelt highlighted the administration\'s move and said climate change "should be addressed on a global basis through multinational agreements" such as the 2015 Paris Agreement. The U.S. hasn\'t withdrawn from that agreement, but the executive order on Tuesday fed concerns that the pact\'s targets will be hard to reach .\n"We believe climate change is real and the science is well accepted," Mr. Immelt wrote. "We hope that the United States continues to play a constructive role in furthering solutions to these challenges."\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce has voiced support for President Trump\'s new policy, saying fewer regulations would lower domestic energy costs and spur economic growth. But many big U.S. corporations, from candy maker Mars Inc. to oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp., have pledged continued support for the Paris Agreement and efforts to reduce emissions.\n"The science is clear and unambiguous: Climate change is real and human activity is a factor," closely held Mars said in a statement this week, adding it was "disappointed the administration has decided to roll back climate regulations."\nOn Tuesday, the world\'s biggest brewer, Anheuser-Busch InBev, committed to get 100% of its global electricity from renewable sources by 2025. "Cutting back on fossil fuels is good for the environment and good for business," CEO Carlos Brito said.\nGE\'s Mr. Immelt has managed to avoid conflict with President Trump, who has been known to lash out at companies, especially on Twitter. The GE leader, who visited the White House in February, supports some administration policy plans, such as revising the tax code. At the same time, he has defended globalization  amid nationalistic and protectionist trends in many countries.\nIn the post, Mr. Immelt said companies have to "have their own \'foreign policy\'" and "learn to adjust to political volatility all over the world."\nGE sells turbines for coal- and gas-fired power plants as well as wind turbines. It has a business unit called Current that is focused on energy savings. He said the conglomerate has spent $20 billion on research into reducing emissions, improving energy efficiency and cutting cost since 2005.\nMr. Trump\'s order begins a review of former President Barack Obama\'s Clean Power Plan , which would have required utilities to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants to 32% below 2005 levels by 2030.\nExxon Chief Executive Darren Woods has also publicly supported the Paris climate deal. Shortly after taking over from Rex Tillerson, who stepped down to become U.S. secretary of state, Mr. Woods wrote in a blog post that "climate risks warrant action and it\'s going to take all of us--business, governments and consumers--to make meaningful progress." The Paris deal is "an effective framework" for dealing with rising emissions, he said.\nDays before the executive order, Exxon reiterated this position in a letter to White House energy adviser George David Banks. Exxon supports the deal in part because it includes pledges to reduce emissions from most of the world\'s countries, unlike the 1997 Kyoto Protocol climate deal, the letter said.\n"We believe that the United States is well positioned to compete within the framework of the Paris Agreement, with abundant low-carbon resources such as natural gas," Peter Trelenberg, an Exxon manager of environmental policy and planning, said in the March 22 letter.\nA number of bigger oil and gas companies have given at least tacit support to the Paris deal because they foresee natural gas benefitting from a possible carbon tax or similar steps to put a price on carbon. Smaller U.S. energy producers have praised the administration\'s steps to roll back limits on the emission of methane--a greenhouse gas believed to be more potent than carbon dioxide--during oil and gas production.\nAnnie Gasparro and Jennifer Maloney contributed to this article.\nWrite to Thomas Gryta at  thomas.gryta@wsj.com  and Bradley Olson at Bradley.Olson@wsj.com\nCredit: By Thomas Gryta and Bradley Olson\n'b'A joint approach must be taken in the battle to adapt to climate change, a report detailing the potential impact on the region states.\nCorangamite Catchment Management Authority\'s plan for climate change, which is now available online, is aiming to provide a blueprint for managing the region\'s assets in a changing climate.\nCorangamite CMA strategy co-ordinator Chris Pitfield said a wide range of feedback was sought for the report.\n"The plan highlights the need to work together in adapting our natural assets to climate change, identify carbon mitigation options and build more resilient landscapes," he said.\nMr Pitfield said the report provided detailed information on how a change in climate was expected to impact the region and provides guidance for management agencies when it comes to developing ways to adapt.\nIn her forward to the report, Corangamite CMA chair Alice Knight wrote that it was vital the region acted now to prepare for climate change.\n"The Corangamite region\'s climate is changing," she said.\n"Projections for our region show a rise in average temperatures, with more hot days and warm spells and the region will generally have less rainfall. It is also projected that there will be an increase in the intensity of extreme rainfall events and the sea level will continue to rise.

So, in the middle of a snowstorm, she and her mother trekked to a climate change conference at the Augusta Civic Center, where they ran across a booth for the Citizens\' Climate Lobby, a national group of citizen volunteers who, with laser-like focus, lobby members of Congress for a market-driven solution to carbon emissions. \n"We saw that booth and it was about a national price on carbon, and I looked at (my mom) and said, \'This is it!\' " Sproul recalled. "The more I learn about the proposal that Citizens\' Climate Lobby has put forth, the more it is totally engaging and viable and the more I want to help the public know that that\'s a real solution for climate change." \nSproul now volunteers with the Citizens\' Climate Lobby, helping them use art to start conversations about what can arguably be a dry and abstract subject. Along with Winslow-based artist Jean Ann Pollard, Sproul is hoping her art can help break down barriers to discussions on climate change, which over the last decade has transformed from a bipartisan issue - albeit with different takes on its causes and solutions - to one that is no longer acknowledged by large swaths of one of the country\'s two major political parties. \n"Art is a great communicator," Sproul said. "It kind of communicates with a deeper, fundamental level in our psyche." \nThis past week Sproul and Pollard\'s artwork traveled to Washington, D.C., for the eighth annual Citizens\' Climate Lobby & Citizens\' Climate Education International Conference & Lobby Day, a three-day conference where about 1,300 volunteers from chapters across the country gathered to learn how to effectively raise public awareness of climate change and carbon pricing, grow the group\'s ranks, and lobby members of Congress to take action. Nearly 1,000 of those volunteers stayed on to lobby staff or officeholders from approximately 500 members of Congress. \nBy all appearances, there is little executive or legislative will to act on climate change, but behind the scenes the Citizens\' Climate Lobby has been successfully working to build consensus around the group\'s carbon fee and dividend proposal, which proponents say is the most effective, market-friendly, bipartisan and fair approach to curbing carbon emissions. \nOriginally conceived by Republicans, the model places a fee on carbon dioxide emissions at the point of extraction, such as oil wells or coal mines. All of the proceeds of the carbon fee then go to American households to help offset rising consumer energy costs as energy companies pass their own increased costs down the supply chain and on to consumers. As the price of carbon increases, the model posits, those companies will move away from carbon-based fuels and increase their investment in non-carbon-producing energies such as solar, wind and nuclear. \nIn 2016, the Citizens\' Climate Lobby documented 1,391 meetings with staff or members of Congress on the carbon fee, up from 106 in 2010. In the last year, the group generated 40,721 letters to Congress, 2,931 media stories and editorials, and held 2,387 outreach events. \nThat pressure has been making an impact. Each year more members from both sides of the aisle are acknowledging the reality of climate change and the need to take preventive action to avoid its worst effects. A growing number have joined the bipartisan House Climate Solutions Caucus, the brainchild of a Citizens\' Climate Lobby volunteer, which works together on policy responses to the causes and impacts of climate change. \nFounded in February 2016, the Climate Solutions Caucus now includes 40 members of Congress, 20 from each party. Members sign up in twos, one Democrat, one Republican, to maintain the group\'s bipartisan balance. At the current rate, the caucus is gaining six new members a month. \nThose numbers are notable in a political environment where mention of the words "climate change" can spell disaster for some politicians. Members of the Citizens\' Climate Lobby attribute their success to the group\'s persistent yet respectful approach to lobbying. \n"One of the things that I have found over the years is that the staff and the members of Congress, if you meet them, are very appreciative of the fact that we come in appreciating them for the work they do," said Peter Garrett, regional coordinator for Citizens\' Climate Lobby chapters in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont. "We don\'t go into an office unless we have a reason on hand to appreciate them for." \nThis past week, Garrett and other volunteers met with staff for all of Maine\'s representatives, urging Reps. Bruce Poliquin and Chellie Pingree to join the House Climate Solutions Caucus and pushing for Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King to sponsor carbon pricing legislation and form an equivalent climate working group in the Senate. \nIn a meeting with staff from Poliquin\'s office, Garrett saw what he believed was new interest in the group\'s work and policy ideas. \nPoliquin spokesman Brendan Conley confirmed that the congressman does not support a climate tax, but said Poliquin "will be reviewing the details of the Climate Solutions Caucus in Congress." \nStaff from Pingree\'s office made clear that Pingree is committed to joining the House climate caucus and needed to find a Republican colleague to join with, Garrett said. \nIn conversations with staff for Sen. Susan Collins last week, Garrett said the group ran through the proposal they would like Collins to put forward and learned that because Collins does not sit on the relevant Senate committee she would need to find another, better-positioned Republican colleague to work with. \nFor Sen. Angus King, already well-versed in the science of climate change, the issue was one of personal political capital and how best to use that capital to make an impact. King has a habit of passing out business-sized cards filled with climate data to his colleagues in the Senate, Garrett said.

Less than an hour after he became president, most references to climate change disappeared from the official White House website.\nBut people like Palm Beach County Commissioner Steven Abrams, a Republican, say Trump should seriously consider the risks to his prized waterfront property, the Mar-a-Lago club and resort in Palm Beach, where he spent  this weekend.\n"Even though he\'s president, Mar-a-Lago is not invulnerable to sea level rise," Abrams said.\nTrump\'s views on global warming conflict with worst-case scenarios from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which projects sea levels rising by more than 6 feet by the end of the century. At that level, the sea would swallow up a portion of Mar-a-Lago, along with surrounding properties in Palm Beach.\nHarold Wanless, chairman of the geological sciences department at the University of Miami, said he thinks that models underestimate sea level rise and that Trump\'s property could be threatened even sooner. The 20-acre estate is nestled between the Intracoastal Waterway and the Atlantic Ocean.\nAs the ocean rises, Mar-a-Lago will become more vulnerable to seasonal king tides, coastal erosion and storm surge. Wanless said he expects most of South Florida\'s barrier islands will become uninhabitable by the middle of the century as roads and sewage systems are swamped by the rising waters.\n"The flooding will become so frequent on barrier islands it will become an unacceptable risk," he said.\nWanless and nine other Florida scientists sent a letter in December to Mar-a-Lago requesting a meeting with Trump on climate change.\n"Many of Florida\'s waterfront properties [including yours] are vulnerable to even minor increases in sea level because of erosion and storm surge," they wrote. "This is not a distant threat. Climate change is making an impact today."\nThere are already areas where oceanfront homes and condominiums, particularly in lower-lying Miami-Dade and Broward counties, will become unlivable and unsellable within a 30-year period, the length of a common mortgage, because of sea level rise, Wanless said.\nTrump has taken a different tone in his public statements. He famously tweeted in 2012 that the Chinese created global warming to hurt U.S. manufacturing.\nBut as a businessman, Trump also moved to protect a golf course in Ireland against the projected effects of climate change. In a meeting with reporters and editors at The New York Times after the election, Trump said there may be "some connectivity" between human activity and climate change.\nHe also said he would keep an "open mind" on keeping the United States in the Paris climate agreement, which has been signed by more than 174 countries and seeks to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). The agreement requires countries to present national plans on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. While targets are not legally binding, participants must report their emissions and progress on meeting goals.\nIn South Florida, both Republicans and Democrats have acted on climate change, putting millions into improving drainage, elevating roads and hiring climate change planners.\nPalm Beach County joined a regional compact on climate change in 2010 with Miami-Dade, Broward and Monroe counties. In 2015, Palm Beach County commissioners hired a climate change coordinator, a position that pays $86,000 a year.\nWhile local efforts have not received large sums of federal dollars, Trump\'s stance could have an effect if federal agencies don\'t play as active of a role on researching climate change, said Jason Liechty, environmental projects coordinator for Broward County.\n"We stand to lose the technical assistance, the support, the help that the federal government provided," he said.\nThe only references to climate change on the White House website is a pledge in Trump\'s "America First Energy Plan" to eliminate "harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule."\nAbrams, one of two Republicans on the seven-member Palm Beach County Commission, said his constituents in Boca Raton are worried that rising seas will inundate expensive oceanfront properties.\n"At the local level," he said, "I don\'t have the luxury of engaging in these lofty debates that they do in Washington - when I am knee-deep in flooding in my coastal communities."\nTrump on climate change\nPresident Donald Trump has often taken a combative tone against climate change, dismissing it as a "hoax" and a concept "created by and for the Chinese."\n*"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive."

The impact of climate change is felt daily by many already now, which is why it is clear that we must act quickly,"Kiisler was quoted by ministry spokespeople as saying in his speech.\nThe minister said that even though this year\'s climate conference is more technical, it does not mean that it would be less important than the Paris climate conference two years ago. The set of rules necessary for implementing the Paris climate agreement is to be approved next year at the climate conference to be held in Katowice, Poland.\nSpeaking about fulfilling the obligations of the EuropeanUnion, Kiisler said that the EuropeanUnion by now has cut back on greenhouse gas emissions by 23 percent compared to 1990. The aim was to decrease emissions by 20 percent by 2020, thus the goal has already been reached. Estonia has cut back on greenhouse gas emissions by 55.3 percent compared to 1990.\nThe presidency of this year\'s conference is the island state of Fiji, but the meeting is held in Bonn, Germany, where the headquarters of the UNFramework Convention on Climate Change are also located. Fiji, which is located in the vastness of the Pacific Ocean, is one of those small islands, which is directly jeopardized by climate change.\nSigned by 195 countries in Paris in December 2015, the Paris Agreement is the first multilateral agreement dealing with climate change, which handles the greenhouse gas emission of nearly the whole world and also includes China, the United States and Russia. The main aim of the agreement is to maintain the increase in world\'s average temperature significantly below 2 degrees in the longer perspective and -- compared to the period prior to the industrial revolution -- keep dangerous climate change under control.\nThe Paris Agreement also stipulates the binding target levels for decreasing greenhouse gases and a reporting system, a dynamic system which would enable to assess and increase the assumed responsibilities in time as well as funding activities concerning climate change and the long-term adaption plan concerning climate change.\nEstonia has also confirmed long-term political guidelines to transfer to an low carbon emission economy , which means the purposeful step-by-step redevelopment of the economic and energy system to be more resourceful, productive and environmentally friendly. Estonia\'s goal by 2050 is to decrease the emission of greenhouse gases approximately 80 percent compared to the 1990 rate.\nThe administration of current U.S. PresidentDonald Trump in August officially notified the UN of the country\'s plan to withdraw from the 2015 Paris Agreement. The United States is the only country in the world not to be a participant of the climate accord.\nTallinn newsroom, +372 610 8827, majandus@bns.ee\nBaltic News Service\n'b'As the debate continues on connection of climate change with growing intensity of hurricanes like Harvey and Irma, climate change is already becoming a ground reality for scores of farmers in the hill state of Mizoram. Changing rainfall pattern and rising temperatures are forcing them to move away from traditional farming and to grow exotic crops that are heat-resistant and can survive erratic rains.\nThis year has been particularly bad. There has not been a single day when it has not rained. Farmers are completely confused. They dont know whether it was early monsoon or it is everyday monsoon. All important dates on the agriculture calendar have been missed, pointed out Dr James Lalnunzira Hrahsel, a scientist with the Mizoram State Climate Change Cell.\nData of the past thirty years shows a rise in average temperature of Aizawl in the month of January. The lowest maximum was 18.7 degree in 1992 while the highest was 28.2 degree in 2005. This January it was 26.3 degree. On the other hand, minimum temperature in January has dipped. The difference between daily minimum and maximum temperature has been widening. The maximum and minimum temperatures in July also have seen a similar trend.\nThe rainfall pattern has changed so drastically that farmers are left clueless. The dates for burning jhums (shifting cultivation) had to be shifted twice this year due to rains. While there is an increasing trend in monsoon rainfall, there is decrease in post-monsoon rainfall and winter rainfall. Heavy precipitation events have gone up.\nThe rainfall pattern in Mizoram has traditionally been so nuanced that Mizo language has different names for rain during different months, like To ruah (for April-May rains), Ruah Bing (for June-July rains), Ruah var pui (September rains), Ai Ruah (for October rains), Pawl del Ruah (December rains) etc. Even wind patterns have unique names - Vahtlao thli (February winds), Pa-sawntlung thli (March to May) and Pa leng thli (July winds) etc., explained Dr Lalrokima Chenkual, a disaster management expert with the Administrative Training Institute.\nBut nowadays, it is difficult to distinguish one rain or wind from another, said Dr Chenkual.\nAll this is directly affecting farming communities. Earlier farmers could grow a variety of fruits and vegetables throughout the year. Now they are approaching us to help them with new crops and varieties that can withstand changing climate. Thats why we have introduced dragon fruit from Thailand, new cabbage variety from China and two tomato varieties from Bangalore, Henry L Varte, horticulture extension officer, told India Science Wire.\nDragon fruit is a cactus that can grow in warm and humid climate, needs less water and its fruits have high commercial value. As dragon fruit is climbing cacti, concrete pillars are erected to train the vine and on the top old tyres are used. Dragon fruit cultivation is helping famers to adapt to rising temperature and erratic rainfall, while protecting their incomes, said Varte. Similarly the cabbage variety imported from China is heat-resistant. Two tomato varieties - Araka Smrat and Araka Rakshak developed the Bangalore-based Indian Institute of Horticulture Institute can withstand high temperatures and are disease-resistant.\nEarlier I used grow oranges from seedlings imported from Israel, but pest attacks started due to heat and the yield dropped. Then I planted area nut. Last year I shifted to dragon fruit and have harvested 20 quintals of fruits this year. The market for this fruit is good, each fruit of about half a kilo sells for about Rs 100 to Rs 150, said Zoramthanga, a dragon fruit farmer from Viapuanpho village in Mamit district.\nMr Saurabh Sharma, state nodal officer for climate change, said adaptation had become necessary as districts in the state face moderate to high vulnerability to climate change in terms of agriculture, forestry and water sector. The National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change is funding a three-year project to augment livelihood of rural communities by building resilience in agriculture in four districts - Aizawl, Mamit, Kolasib, Serchhip.\nThe idea is to develop one climate resilient village in each district so that they can serve as model for the rest, Sharma explained while speaking at a media workshop. Mr Pradeep Chettri from Directorate of Agriculture (Crop Husbandry) said pilot projects were underway in three agro-climatic zones - humid mild tropical zone, humid sub-tropical hill zone and humid temperate sub-alpine zone- to increase tolerance and suitability of crops to climate change.\nThe media workshop was organized by the Indian Himalayas Climate Adaptation Programme (IHCAP) and Department of Science and Technology (DST) in collaboration with Mizoram State Climate Change Cell; Directorate of Science and Technology and Centre for Media Studies.\nDinesh C Sharma writes for India Science Wire; @dineshcsharma\n'b'\nFor a prime minister who claims to champion science and oppose climate change, Justin Trudeau has a strange way of showing it.\nThe funding for Canada\'s Climate Change and Atmospheric Research program was not renewed in the 2017 federal budget and will soon expire - meaning the eventual end of a vital, national environmental program.\nYet for reasons that are not clear, Trudeau and his Liberals will not commit to providing the lifesaver grant that would keep this initiative afloat.\nLetting the program die would be a serious mistake - and experts are saying so. \nMore than 250 scientists from 22 countries recently signed a letter to Trudeau, urging him to restore or replace the Climate Change and Atmospheric Research program and warning its elimination means "a crisis is looming" in Canadian climate science.\nYet their reasoned and reasonable plea has gone unanswered.\nThis lack of response is a puzzle because it so blatantly contradicts the politics and policies Trudeau continually avows.\nSupporting scientific research and aggressively tackling climate change have been core Liberal values for years - and were meant to show the party was different from and better than Stephen Harper\'s Conservatives, who were portrayed as anti-science, climate-change foot-draggers.\n"We are serious about climate change," Trudeau said just weeks after winning the 2015 fall election. "This means making decisions based on science."\nAnd last September he boasted: "We have taken great strides to fulfil our promise to restore science as a pillar of government decision-making."\nExcept, it seems, when it comes to funding "the only dedicated program funding climate and atmospheric research in Canada." \nThat\'s how more than 250 scientists characterized the program in their letter, which was published this week by the advocacy group, Evidence for Democracy. \nThey say the program\'s loss "will be felt far beyond Canada\'s borders."\nTo be fair to the government, it does pay for work done by government scientists employed by Environment and Climate Change Canada. \nBut the Climate Change and Atmospheric Research program is different. And unique.\nThe program allows universities across Canada to collaborate as they gather and review data. \nIt allows them to examine how changes in sea ice and snow cover affect our Arctic regions. \nIt helps them explore how carbon dioxide moves between the atmosphere and the ocean. \nAnd it brings Canadian evidence and a Canadian perspective to a problem that will impact not just Canada but the world.\nIt\'s not terribly expensive, either. It provided seven projects with $1 million a year for five years. The best known of these projects, the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory on Ellesmere Island, has been granted a temporary reprieve - funding for 18 more months. \nThe six other projects are cutting research staff and preparing for the end.\nSurely this government can do better.\nAs the Liberals prepare the 2018-19 federal budget, they should find the cash to keep this major research program going or put something even bigger in its place.\nThe needs of science and a warming planet demand no less. \nCAPTION: \n\n\n'b'A recent study on the economic impact of climate change shows how vulnerable Israel, and the whole Middle East, are to climate change David Rosenberg Warmer places will be harder hit by global warming, study shows Gil Eliahu\nSeventy years from now, places like Texas, Georgia and Oklahoma will not only be a lot hotter than they are now because of climate change. They will also be a lot poorer -- perhaps as much as 20% poorer than they would be if temperatures remained stable.\nWhat those states have in common is that they are already hot. Climate change will not only raise temperatures: it will take a steep toll on the economy, according to a path-breaking study that explores the economic impact of a warmer globe on the United States county by county in Science magazine two weeks ago.\nBy contrast, if you are living in a relatively cold place like Maine, the state\'s gross domestic product by the end of the century could be as much as 10% bigger. Yet, for the whole of the U.S., even with its huge land mass and variable climes, climate change is a net negative: GDP could suffer a loss of 6%, depending on how much temperatures rise.\n\nAlready hot  \nGlobally, by the end of the 21st century the poorest third of counties will suffer a loss of between 2% and 20% of national income if no measures are taken to control rising temperature, says the study by the Climate Impact Lab, a collaboration of climate scientists, economists, computational experts, researchers, analysts, and students.\nAnd what will Israel look like 70 or 80 years from now? The study didn\'t conduct a detailed analysis of the world outside lower 48 U.S. states, but the pattern is unmistakable. "A rise in temperatures is a lot more damaging if you\'re living in a place that\'s already hot," Solomon Hsiang, a Berkeley professor and lead author of the study, told The New York Times.\nIsrael is hot in some places and hotter in others - there\'s no place to escape the effects of climate change through internal migration to more temperate regions as there is in the U.S. Ergo, we should be prepared to be hit as hard as the hottest U.S. states. Also, there are no predictions that the Middle East will get cooler and wetter with climate change, only hotter and drier.\nHow climate change can hurt economies is fairly obvious. Rising sea levels will flood cities, damage from hurricanes will grow, crops will wither, and mortality rates will climb.\nBut measuring the actual damage and where and when it will occur is tricky. It\'s been easier for climate change skeptics to point to the costs of fighting the phenomenon than to estimate the costs of doing nothing.\nThat\'s where the Climate Change Lab study marks an important advance, because it breaks down the costs and showing where they will fall.\n\nRecurring heat waves \nThe biggest cost is higher rates of mortality as more human beings succumb to recurring heat waves. By the end of the century, the Climate Change Lab study says,deaths by heat could roughly approximate deaths by auto accidents.\nAs the temperature rises, people working out of doors will become less productive. Meanwhile, energy costs will grow as utilities are forced to bulk up generating capacity for surging air conditioner usage. There\'s also the direct damage of flooding and storms and the loss of crops.\nEven the authors admit their study is by no means conclusive. It measures the economic impact based on the historical experience of heat waves. But an overall hotter world will have huge knock-on effects, like the cost of mass migrations, rising sea levels and damaged ecosystems, all of which will inflate costs.\nOn the other hand, humans will no doubt come up with all kinds of technology fixes to cope with the changing climates, such as farmers switching to crops better suited to warmer temperatures and cities are erecting cooling stations for overheated pedestrians.\nNo doubt Israelis will be there thinking up clever ways to cope with the climate, and some time around 2070, someone will sure to be writing a best-seller "Cool-Down Nation," touting Israeli ingenuity in the field.\nBut the technology would have to be pretty fundamental to mitigate a long list of losses for Israel - more disease, forests fires and flooding, a loss of crops and a lower quality of life, as cited in a 2014 Environmental Affairs Ministry report.\nIsrael has been a leader in water technology, which will be critical for coping with a warmer world, but barring a revolution, the cost of desalination and waste water treatment will be far more expensive than it is today.\nAt least, Israel has the technology and resources to cope. But our neighbors don\'t.\nThe Middle East we see today of brutal wars and desperate refugees is only a taste of things to come if large parts of the region become uninhabitable. It is hard to imagine how Israel will be able to remain aloof.\nDonald Trump thinks he is stabilizing the Middle East by confronting Iran and taking a stab at reviving Israeli-Palestinian talks, but in the long run, he will have done more harm for the region and its people by pulling out of the Paris climate accords.\nDavid Rosenberg\nHaaretz Contributor\nDavid Rosenberg\n Haaretz Daily Newspaper Ltd.

The additional $500 million comes from the State Department\'s Fiscal Year 2016 budget, according to a spokesman for Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), a senior Democrat on the Senate appropriations committee.\nState Department spokesman John Kirby said the fund is "a critical tool" and said the Obama administration remains committed to the fund.\n"It\'s not being done to try to provoke a reaction from the incoming administration or to try to dictate to them one way or another how they are going to deal with climate issues," Mr. Kirby said, adding that the investment had been long-planned.\nThe global climate fund is part of a broader international effort to address climate change, including a 2015 deal\n agreed to by nearly 200 countries in Paris. Mr. Trump has said he would withdraw the U.S. from that deal, though since the election he said he would have an open mind to staying in it.\nMr. Leahy pointed to a comment by Rex Tillerson \n, Mr. Trump\'s pick to head the State Department, at his recent confirmation hearing. Mr. Tillerson, who until recently was CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp., said the U.S. would be better served staying in the deal than withdrawing, and that climate change was a threat that should be addressed.\n"I commend the administration for making this contribution," Mr. Leahy said in a statement. "It will help give us a \'seat at the table\' in future climate change negotiations which even President--elect Trump\'s nominee to be Secretary of State endorsed as part of our nation\'s global leadership."\nA request for comment to Mr. Trump\'s transition team wasn\'t immediately returned.\nFelicia Schwartz contributed to this article.\nWrite to Amy Harder at amy.harder@wsj.com\nCredit: By Amy Harder\n'b'A new U.S. government report drew a direct line between human activity and the quickening pace of climate change, saying the future emissions of greenhouse gasses would determine how warm the earth gets and how quickly sea levels rise.\n"The last three years have been the warmest years on record for the globe," according to National Climate Assessment\n . "Many lines of evidence demonstrate that it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century."\nThe report was produced by the Global Change Research Program, which is mandated by federal law to produce a comprehensive climate assessment. The report was crafted by scientists from 13 federal agencies, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Energy Department and the Environmental Protection Agency. The findings are based on scientific, peer-reviewed research, plus publicly available data sets and assessments of previous reports written by federal agencies, according to the report.\nThe report\'s statement that reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions could mitigate the expected rise in global temperatures comes as the Trump administration has rolled back U.S. efforts to limit emissions. Most notably, President Donald Trump moved to pull the country from the Paris climate accord\n , the global push to slow carbon emissions, saying it stepped on U.S. sovereignty and constrained American industry.\nWithout major reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions, global temperatures could stand at 9F (5C) or above preindustrial levels by the end of the century, according to the new Climate Science Special Report. With deep cuts in emissions, the change could be limited to 3.6F (2C) or less, the report said. It noted that in 2014 and 2015, the pace of carbon-emissions growth did slow, but not at a fast-enough rate to significantly slow future temperature rises. The report doesn\'t make policy recommendations.\n"The magnitude of climate change beyond the next few decades will depend primarily on the amount of greenhouse gases (especially carbon dioxide) emitted globally," the report said.\nAmong its findings was that the global average sea level has risen by about seven to eight inches since 1900, but nearly half of that increase has happened in the past 25 years or so. That is already affecting cities in the U.S. along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, where tidal flooding is becoming more commonplace, according to the report.\nLooking ahead, the report says sea levels are expected to rise by at least several inches in the next 15 years and by one to four feet by 2100.\nAverage surface air temperature has increased by about 1.8F over the past 115 years, with recent years serving "record-breaking, climate-related extremes," according to the report. Heavy rains, heat waves, and forest fires are becoming more frequent, the report said. Last month, California experienced some of the most savage fires on record\n , leaving many without homes and dozens dead.\nScientists have also observed changes in ocean temperatures, plus melting glaciers and diminishing snow cover and sea ice, according to the report, which was released Friday. Wednesday, NASA published maps showing that two to four times as many of Greenland\'s coastal glaciers are at risk of accelerated melting as previously thought. This summer, a massive iceberg broke off from Antarctica\n . Scientists disagree over the role of climate change in that event.\nThe change in climate will also affect human health and productivity, according to the report and other studies. In its Countdown 2017, the medical journal The Lancet published data showing rising temperatures have resulted in a 5.3% decrease in the global labor capacity of rural workers between 2000 and 2016. The capacity of mosquitoes to spread dengue fever has increased globally by almost 10% since 1950 and in Southeast Asia, air pollution contributed to more than 1.9 million deaths in 2015. The Lancet also reported that 125 million more people over the age of 65--an already vulnerable population--were exposed to heat waves in 2016 than in 2000.\nIn the federal report, scientists say they expect the number of days with temperatures above 90F (32C) will rise, while the number with below-freezing temperatures will decline.\nPresident Trump was an outspoken skeptic of climate change before he entered politics, calling it an "expensive hoax" and a concept invented by the Chinese. Since entering the Oval Office, Mr. Trump has backed steps to reverse policies meant to combat climate change, but largely has avoided stating his position on the science.\nIn June, Mr. Trump announced that the U.S. would exit the Paris climate accord, while leaving open the possibility of negotiating the deal or crafting a new one on better terms. The U.S. has the world\'s second highest level of greenhouse-gas emissions, behind China. Under the Paris agreement, the U.S. aimed to cut carbon-dioxide emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by the year 2025.\nUnited Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley subsequently said Mr. Trump "believes the climate is changing. And he believes pollutants are part of the equation." She added: "Just because we got out of a club doesn\'t mean that we don\'t care about the environment."\nThis week, the EPA barred scientists receiving agency grants from serving on its scientific advisory boards, a move critics charged was unnecessary and aimed at eroding the influence of scientists in general.\nTim Hanrahan contributed to this article\nWrite to Daniela Hernandez at  daniela.hernandez@wsj.com\nFindings in the climate report\nSource: National Climate Assessment\n* Current period is warmest in the history of modern civilization\n* U.S. average annual temperatures expected to rise by about 2.5F in U.S. by 2050\n* Heatwaves have become more frequent in the U.S. since the 1960s\n* Major cuts in carbon emissions could limit rise in global temperatures\n* Sea level has risen by about seven to eight inches since 1900, with nearly half of increase coming since 1993\n* By the year 2100, sea levels are expected to rise by another one to four feet; eight feet can\'t be ruled out\n* Heavy rainfall will continue to increase in intensity and frequency in U.S. and globally\n* CO2 levels now in range last seen three million years ago, when earth was warmer\nCredit: By Daniela Hernandez\n'b'HAMBURG--Leaders from the Group of 20 countries vowed Saturday to fight protectionism and secure fair trade, finding a broad consensus after President Donald Trump\'s defiantly unilateral stance exposed a rift between the world\'s leading economies.\nIn light of the broad political pushback against globalization and the rise in antiestablishment forces in recent years, however, the G-20 stepped back from an unequivocal commitment to free trade for the first time since its inaugural summit in 2008. Instead, it recognized the need for defensive measures in pursuit of balanced trade.\nIn another unprecedented move, the group broke from unanimity in its final communiqu, splitting off the U.S. position on climate change from that of the other members.\nIn the summit\'s concluding statement, the G-20 noted "the importance of reciprocal and mutually advantageous trade and investment frameworks." But in a nod to concerns of Mr. Trump and other leaders over trade imbalances, the group also said it would "strive to ensure a level playing field." The phrase seemed to reflect concerns of the U.S. and some European member states over China\'s expanding footprint in the global economy.\nSecuring the support of Mr. Trump, whose "America First" policies pose a potential clash with the international economic order, was the dominant theme among officials as the gathering drew to a close.\n"The negotiations on the climate issue reflected dissent--everyone against the United States of America," said German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who held the rotating G-20 presidency over the last year. "And that the negotiations on the trade issue were especially tough was also a result of the United States taking certain positions."\nIn a tweet on Saturday, Mr. Trump wrote: "The #G20Summit was a wonderful success and carried out beautifully by Chancellor Angela Merkel. Thank you!"\nA European official said the talks demonstrated that a new--and different--international consensus on economic issues could be slowly rebuilt despite the challenges thrown up by Mr. Trump\'s positions.\nOne bellwether will be an international effort to curb the world\'s excess capacity of steel, as Mr. Trump considers unilateral measures to protect the U.S. market. On Saturday, the G-20 agreed to outline by November steps to temper the global overcapacity upending local markets.\n"All things considered, my impression is that we\'re getting back in small steps in many areas to a greater degree of business as usual," the official said.\nYet some leaders warned the statement won\'t close deep divides on trade that have emerged since Mr. Trump\'s election.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron took swipes at Mr. Trump and others during the two-day summit for equating fair trade with avoiding bilateral deficits. Brandishing his smart phone during the session on trade, Mr. Macron said many products consumed in G-20 countries rely on global production chains, according to delegates. Mr. Trump had left the room when the French leader spoke, they said.\n"A text does not efface tensions that exist and will continue to exist on this subject for a long time," Mr. Macron said during a press briefing as the summit concluded, describing the trade approach adopted by the U.S. president as "a profound error."\nThe U.S. wasn\'t alone in its views on trade, officials said. On some points, such as promoting support for defensive measures against unfair trade, Mr. Trump was joined by other leaders, including the Turkish and EU presidents and Mr. Macron.\nFor most world leaders, however, one of the summit\'s achievements was getting Mr. Trump to back international organizations that underpin global trade.\nAhead of the summit, G-20 officials cited concerns that Mr. Trump would go beyond his decision to scrap a 12-country trans-Pacific trade pact  and renegotiate America\'s trade agreement with Canada and Mexico to undermine broader platforms such as the World Trade Organization. The White House has launched a review  of the WTO, with an eye toward proposing reforms.But in Hamburg the U.S. joined the other G-20 members in reiterating a commitment to safeguard rules-based global trade under the WTO umbrella.\n"Working together isn\'t just the best option, it\'s the only option. Indeed it\'s the only way we can meet the challenges of the 21st century," Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said at the end of the summit.\nLeaders overseeing 80% of the global economy also need to address the anxieties of people disenfranchised by globalization, Mr. Trudeau said, adding that the G-20 had heard the concerns of tens of thousands of demonstrators--a small but violent section of whom rioted in Hamburg throughout the summit.\nSignaling the difficulties ahead in squaring cooperation with Mr. Trump\'s demands, G-20 members wrangled for days to find a joint position on climate change in the aftermath of Mr. Trump\'s decision to reject the Paris Agreement against global warming.\nIn the end, they could only split the difference. Germany, a staunch supporter of action against global warming, led the "very difficult" negotiations to reaffirm 19 members\' commitment to the Paris accord while accommodating Mr. Trump\'s stance, officials said.\nTo that end, Mr. Trump\'s negotiators were able to insert a line into the communiqu on the U.S. helping other countries "access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently," according to an EU official.\n"The inclusion of this paragraph is the trade-off of having a consensual approach," the EU official said. "Obviously, to have in the text a reference to these kind of energy sources is not something we like."\nMr. Macron\'s team pushed hard to isolate the U.S. on climate change, a French official said, and safeguard the 2015 accord signed by every country in the world except Syria and Nicaragua. Signatories overwhelmingly rallied behind the deal after Mr. Trump\'s decision to pull the U.S. out.\n"We don\'t want any contagion," the French official said.\nIn a move that could further isolate the U.S, Mr. Macron announced a Dec. 12 gathering to mark the second anniversary of the Paris accord, with a focus on financing environmental projects.\nWhile isolated in leaving the climate deal, Mr. Trump wasn\'t alone in criticizing its implementation so far. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that despite joining the G-20 communiqu in reaffirming Paris Agreement commitments, Ankara would withhold ratification because financial pledges by Mr. Macron\'s predecessor hadn\'t yet been delivered.\n"Following America\'s step, our stance currently is also that this should not pass in parliament," Mr. Erdogan said, adding that the communiqu papered over unease about the climate pact.\nAnother sticking point at the annual G-20 gathering was migration. Russia and China blocked an effort by the European Union--supported in principle by the U.S.--to pursue United Nations sanctions against human traffickers, according to EU officials. But G-20 leaders did commit to countering migrant smuggling and human trafficking for the first time in their conclusions, without offering any specifics.\n"The reference to countering migrant smugglers and bringing them to justice is a very important step," another EU official said.\nDespite the lack of greater consensus on migration and climate change, the G-20 members did find language suggesting a shared commitment to staving off what many officials had flagged ahead of the summit as a major risk: trade wars.\n"International trade and investment are important engines of growth," the G-20 leaders said. "We will strive to ensure a level playing field, in particular by promoting a favorable environment for trade and investment."\nAnton Troianovski and Andrea Thomas contributed to this article.\nWrite to Emre Peker at  emre.peker@wsj.com  and William Horobin at William.Horobin@wsj.com\nRelated\n* G-20 Riot Leaves Officials Scrambling for Answers\n* Trump, Putin Spar on Hacks, Act on Syria\n* Trump Clashes With Global Leaders Over Trade\n* Nearly 200 Injured in Violent G-20 Protests in Germany\nCredit: By Emre Peker and William Horobin\n'b'"Troubled Waters\n " (Review, Oct. 21) ought to remind us that the biggest environmental problem in the world isn\'t climate change but miserable national environmental scorecards that measure the health of a country\'s water, air, land, human health and habitats.\nEnvironmentalists would have us believe that development and affluence are the chief culprits, but the evidence clearly shows that transparent representative democracies with strong and affluent middle classes have far better environmental scorecards than autocracies (Russia, China, Iran) and graft-laden nominal democracies with fragile middle classes (Turkey, Brazil, India). If we don\'t get the root cause right, how can we find the right solutions?\nThomas M. Doran\nPlymouth, Mich.\n'b'NEW YORK--Trump administration officials said Saturday the U.S. wouldn\'t pull out of the Paris Agreement, offering to re-engage in the international deal to fight climate change, according to multiple officials at a global warming summit.\nThe U.S. position on reviewing the terms of its participation in the landmark accord came during a meeting of more than 30 ministers led by Canada, China and the European Union in Montreal. In June, President Donald Trump said the U.S. would withdraw from the deal  unless it could find more favorable terms.\nU.S. officials in Montreal, led by White House senior adviser Everett Eissenstat, broached revising U.S. climate-change goals, two participants said, signaling a compromise that would keep the U.S. at the table even if it meant weakening the international effort. Still, the move would maintain international unity behind the painstakingly negotiated Paris accord, after Mr. Trump suggested he might seek a new agreement.\n"The U.S. has stated that they will not renegotiate the Paris accord, but they will try to review the terms on which they could be engaged under this agreement," European Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy Miguel Arias Caete said.\nIn a statement Saturday afternoon, a White House spokeswoman said the administration\'s position on Paris had not changed, but also noted that the president\'s stance on withdrawing from the deal had never been set in stone.\n"There has been no change in the U.S.\'s position on the Paris agreement," said deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters. "As the president has made abundantly clear, the U.S. is withdrawing unless we can re-enter on terms that are more favorable to our country."\nMultiple participants at the Montreal gathering said Mr. Eissenstat\'s approach, though it is likely to entail a significant reduction in the U.S.\'s ambition to curb greenhouse-gas emissions, fueled optimism among proponents of the Paris deal. Since Mr. Trump\'s inauguration in January, officials from China to the EU and Canada have tried to convince his administration that fighting climate change is also a boon for the economy and jobs, and not just an ideological battle.\n"We are pleased the U.S. continues to engage and recognize the economic opportunity of clean growth, including clean energy," said Canadian Environment Minister Catherine McKenna in a statement to The Wall Street Journal.\nIn announcing the decision to withdraw the U.S. from the 195-nation agreement at the White House in June, Mr. Trump said he was ready to "begin negotiations to re-enter either the Paris accord or an--really entirely new transaction--on terms that are fair to the U.S., its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers."\n"So we\'re getting out, but we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that\'s fair," he added. "And if we can, that\'s great. And if we can\'t, that\'s fine."\nThe U.S. has the world\'s second highest level of greenhouse-gas emissions, which drive global warming, behind China. Washington\'s exit from the Paris deal would undermine its viability and could trigger other exits , unraveling an agreement that took decades to negotiate.\nWashington is reviewing new emission-cut targets to combat climate change, Mr. Eissenstat said, according to one of the participants at the meeting. Any revisions would lower existing U.S. commitments signed by former President Barack Obama, which would be a blow to the global effort, the official said. Under the Paris accord, every country set its own goals.\nWhile Mr. Eissenstat, deputy assistant to the president for international economic affairs and deputy director of the National Economic Council, outlined a plan to reassure partners that the U.S. would be constructive, he did not provide clarity on the new emissions-reduction objectives, the official said. The National Economic Council is led by Gary Cohn, Mr. Trump\'s top economic adviser.\n"They are seriously considering the terms on which the U.S. could re-engage," the official said. "They have also made clear that they have no intention to renegotiate or develop a parallel track to Paris."\nMr. Cohn is expected to reiterate Mr. Eissenstat\'s message in Montreal during an informal breakfast meeting to discuss international energy and climate issues with the world\'s top ministers, the official said.\nCanada, China and the EU organized the ministerial meeting in Montreal just before world leaders descend on New York for the United Nations General Assembly.\nSigned in 2015 under a U.N. effort to fight climate change , the Paris deal is also on the agenda as countries seek to meet their global commitment to limit the global temperature increases to "well below" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with preindustrial levels. The only countries that aren\'t signatories to the accord are Syria and Nicaragua.\nSome major U.S. energy companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp., had urged Mr. Trump not to withdraw from the Paris accord. Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods went public earlier this year with his point of view that the U.S. should remain in the agreement.\nSome players in the energy industry, including the chiefs of some shale companies, supported the move to leave the Paris Accord.\nWhether or not the U.S. opts to stay, the country\'s emissions of greenhouse gases are widely predicted to continue declining, as gas power replaces coal, helped by bountiful supplies of cheap natural gas. The declining cost of renewable power, including wind and solar, is also forecast to play a role in reducing emissions.\nWhen Mr. Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris in June, executives at many U.S. companies, in the energy sector and beyond, signaled that they intended to continue taking steps to reduce emissions by their companies .\nStates and cities around the U.S. also vowed to adhere to their own aggressive climate policies , independent of the federal government.\nPaul Vieira, Eli Stokols and Elena Cherney contributed to this article.\nWrite to Emre Peker at  emre.peker@wsj.com\nRelated\n* U.S., China Agree on Implementing Paris Climate-Change Pact  (Sept. 3, 2016)\n* Trump Withdraws from Paris Climate Deal  (June 1)\n* Companies Expect Little Change  (June 1)\n* Move Draws Rebuke From World Leaders  (June 1)\n* Leaving Accord Takes Time  (June 1)\n* U.S. Pivot Puts Reluctant China in Driver\'s Seat  (June 2)\n* Aides Defend Decision to Exit Paris Accord  (June 4)\nCredit: By Emre Peker\n'b'Encana Corp. is named in three large lawsuits that attempt to link damages from climate change to industry\'s alleged attempts to hinder action to address it.\nIn the latest of a growing number of such lawsuits around the world, the Calgary-based company is one of 20 energy majors and their subsidiaries facing claims from three California communities. They allege the companies have deliberately sown misinformation and doubt on climate change and are at least partially responsible for related damages such as shoreline erosion.\n"Defendants ... have known for nearly a half century that unrestricted production and use of their fossil fuel products create greenhouse gas pollution that warms the planet and changes our climate," says the lawsuit filed by the City of Imperial Beach.\n"They have nevertheless engaged in a co-ordinated, multifront effort to conceal and deny their own knowledge of those threats, discredit the growing body of publicly available scientific evidence, and persistently create doubt in the minds of customers, consumers, regulators, the media, journalists, teachers, and the public about the reality and consequences of the impacts of their fossil fuel pollution."\nEncana has not responded to requests for comment.\nThe lawsuits, filed Monday in California, draw on legal precedents used against tobacco companies, which reached a U.S. settlement of $368.5-billion (U.S.) in 1998.\n"The plaintiffs have an uphill battle, but these are plausible claims," said Michael Burger, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School.\nMr. Burger said that, as with tobacco companies, the energy industry knew its business was creating problems. Reports quoting documents from Exxon\'s archives suggest its management was told by its own scientists about greenhouse gases and climate change as early as 1977.\nInstead of addressing the problem, the lawsuits allege, industry deployed think tanks, lobbyists and other means to obscure the science and resist regulation - much like the tobacco industry.\n"You have a similar history of corporate malfeasance," Mr. Burger said.\nBut the climate lawsuits will have a much tougher time linking specific damages to industry actions, he said.\n"To get from pulling it out of the ground all the way through the chain of manufacture, marketing, combustion - and through the climate change reality and then to sea-level rise causing specific impacts in these places - is a much longer chain of causation."\nSimilar lawsuits have been thrown out.\nVic Sher, the lawyer handling the litigation, said his lawsuits avoid conflicts with federal law that disallowed earlier attempts.\nFresh reports have made industry attempts to block change much clearer, he said. As well, research now allows scientists to make direct links between greenhouse gases, sea-level rise and individual producers.\n"That causal connection we can now tie to particular companies."\nThe claim alleges the defendants are collectively behind about 20 per cent of total CO2 emissions between 1965 and 2015.\n"It\'s an enormous volume and a substantial contribution to the problem," Mr. Sher said.\nKate Sears, supervisor for Marin County just north of San Francisco, said her communities are already suffering.\nPreviously rare flooding tides now occur about 15 times a year, she said. The only roads in and out for some coastal communities have been submerged.\nA county assessment concluded in April that within 15 years, tidal flooding could threaten at least $15.5-billion in public and private assets, from homes to schools to wetlands.\n"Climate change is not a theoretical problem for us," Ms. Sears said. "It\'s very, very real."\nMartin Olszynski, a University of Calgary law professor who has published research on similarities between climate change and tobacco liability, said the cases are highly relevant to Canada as different court systems try to deal with the issue.\n"Everyone\'s watching to see what different courts are doing, especially countries that share that common law tradition," he said. "There\'s a cumulative effect - you start to see more and more of these."\nA report in March for the United Nations counted 654 cases in 24 countries that dealt with the science of climate change and mitigation efforts.\nEncana (ECA)\nClose: $12.17, down 36\nCredit: The Canadian Press\n'b'Cornell University issued the following news release:\nOn the heels of President Donald Trump\'s decision to pull the United States out of the Paris climate agreement, a new Cornell University study finds that labels matter when it comes to acceptance of climate science.\nThe U.S. public doubts the existence of "global warming" more than it doubts "climate change" - and Republicans are driving the effect, the research shows.\nIn a nationally representative survey, 74.4 percent of respondents identified as Republicans said they believed that climate change is really happening. But only 65.5 percent said they believed in global warming. In contrast, 94 percent of Democrats replied "yes" to both questions.\nSome Republicans may discredit climate science because they may not like the policies that have been proposed to address the problem, said the study\'s co-author, Jonathon Schuldt, assistant professor of communication at Cornell.\n"Acknowledging the reality of global warming or climate change may lead to new government regulations on businesses, which goes against core conservative values," Schuldt said. "So, telling a pollster that the phenomenon isn\'t happening may reflect something about a person\'s general policy preferences, not just their level of certainty that the global climate is changing."\nThe research is an extension of an earlier study co-written by Schuldt. The first study included references to temperatures going up versus changing. The new research focuses on how labels impact acceptance of climate-science in a now more charged political environment.\nNonetheless, it\'s important to remember that 65 percent of Republicans did indicate that global warming is occurring, said co-author Peter Enns, associate professor of government. "In other words, although the term matters - climate change versus global warming - an overwhelming majority of Republicans still state that global warming is happening," he said.\nThe labels\' effect the researchers identified is especially relevant given Trump\'s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement, Enns said. "Nearly 75 percent of Republicans in our sample indicated that climate change is really happening and almost all coverage of Trump\'s decision on this issue emphasizes the word \'climate.\'"\nIn contrast, Trump\'s Twitter messages use "global warming" more often than "climate change" and often characterize global warming as a hoax. The researchers conducted a search of Trump\'s tweets and found 106 contained "global warming" but only 36 mentioned "climate change."\n"Our results suggest that Trump\'s emphasis on \'global warming\' may be an effective rhetorical strategy that resonates with his Republican constituents, who express more skepticism in response to that term in particular," said Schuldt.\nAlthough the United States seems to be entering a new era of climate politicization, the chasm between Republicans and Democrats on climate science might not be as large as it seems, Schuldt said.\n"If you ask people what they think about climate change - not global warming - we find that the partisan gap shrinks by about 30 percent," he said. "There\'s actually more agreement here than we think."\nThis research appeared in the journal "Climatic Change" ( 07M-Tagaruma\n'b'SHARJAH, 22nd March, 2017 (WAM) -- Day one of the sixth International Government Communication Forum (IGCF 2017) concluded with an insightful panel discussion on the importance of putting civil society at the centre of the climate change dialogue across the globe.\nEnvironmental experts from the public and private sectors concurred on this point at the session themed \'Environment and Climate Change in Media Policies\'. Both segments agreed that media communication needs to be impactful and relay the right messages to civil society to enable them to effect meaningful change.\nMark Schapiro, an author and award-winning journalist specialising in international environmental stories, moderated the discussion. Panellists included His Excellency Dr. Thani bin Ahmed Al-Zeyoudi, UAE Minister of Climate Change and Environment, John Bruton, former Prime Minister of Ireland, former EU Ambassador to the US and Chairman of International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) Ireland, Khaled Issa Al Huraimel, CEO of Sharjah environmental company Bee\'ah, Safa\' Al Jayoussi, Head of Climate and Energy Campaign in Arab World, Founder and Executive Director for IndyACT in Jordan and winner of the 2016 Young Energy Professional of the Year Award, and Kehkashan Basu, UAE-based student and winner of the 2016 International Children\'s Peace Prize.\nRepresenting the viewpoint of the public sector, Dr. Thani Al-Zeyoudi said: "The UAE Cabinet has agreed on the UAE Centennial 2071 to make our government the best in the world. This shows that we are well aligned with a long-term vision for the nation. In terms of communicating the effects of climate change, studies show that less than 19 per cent of nations globally are engaged in environmental dialogue, which shows that people are disengaged on this topic.\n"We as a government need to convey these complex concepts to our communities, as well as impress upon them the consequences and impact of their actions. In this context, we find the role of the media to be very important, especially in simplifying the concepts for the people. Unfortunately, much of the media reporting today focuses on the catastrophic nature of climate change. Whereas, in my opinion, the media needs to additionally shed light on the positive actions that are being taken to mitigate environmental degradation."\nGiving the example of the Heroes of the UAE initiative, he added: "The UAE has effectively used this platform to educate children on the effects of climate change, and to encourage them to enable positive environmental behaviour within the household. Issues such as the impending water crisis in the region need to be conveyed with a sense of urgency to the people to help them become participants in the relevant interventions such as the UAE Energy Plan 2050 to make renewables account for as much as 44 per cent of our nation\'s energy mix."\nIn response to Kehkashan Basu\'s question on how to integrate the youth in the climate change dialogue, Dr. Thani Al-Zeyoudi said: "We need to build up the environmental responsibilities of the youth through the education system. In the UAE, our leaders created a new Ministry of Youth last year, which has also been instrumental in establishing national and local youth councils that seek to get the youth involved in addressing the nation\'s challenges. The Ministry of Climate Change also worked recently with youth across the region to create Arab Youth Centres that aim to involve the youth in the future dialogue."\nSpeaking on the role of the private sector in the climate change dialogue, Safa\' Al Jayoussi said: "Private sector entities play a major role in communicating the needs of the people to the government, as well as in advocating for change. There is an urgency in this region to create a dialogue between the public and private sector as well as civil society. Unfortunately, climate change does not seem to be a priority, with the UAE being an exception. The steps the UAE has taken, including the establishment of the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment, shows that the country cares about environmental challenges. Across the region, we need to be able to communicate the benefits of climate change intervention, especially from a cost-cutting perspective."\nDemonstrating the success of public-private partnerships for environmental causes, Khaled Issa Al Huraimel said: "Bee\'ah was created as a public-private partnership with the aim of addressing the huge waste management challenge we faced in the UAE, and establishing Sharjah as the environmental capital of the Middle East. Today, seven years after we envisioned this goal, I can safely say we have achieved record rates of over 70 per cent waste management away from the landfills. We are also actively involved in taking our vision across the UAE and the region. To this effect, we have tied up with Masdar to develop renewable energy sources. Our work at Bee\'ah, in collaboration with the Sharjah Government and Shurooq, also extends to managing air quality and water quality, all of which will ensure a better future for the region\'s environment. While most environmental initiatives in the region are fully run by the private sector, we have learnt that there are great benefits to working hand in hand with the government."\nSpeaking from the perspective of the EU nations, John Burton said: "The success of environmental intervention, such as recycling initiatives and setting of zero-landfill targets, has been largely driven by the fact that these targets are set individually for each country in the EU with clear indications of penalties, such as fines levied in case of violation. This has worked in most EU nations, except in cases such as Poland, which has a coal-driven market, or Ireland, where methane gas from livestock created environmental hazards. Within this framework, however, we find that it is very important to get the people on your side, to make the decision to recycle. Moreover, we need to repeatedly remind the people of the impact their household decisions could have on their own children and future generations."\nThe IGCF 2017 runs from March 22 to 23 at Expo Centre Sharjah. Under the Theme \'Societal Participation Comprehensive Development\', IGCF 2017 examines how the world\'s nations can leverage effective government communication to achieve the United Nations\' sustainable development goals (SDGs) that have become the top priority of government programmes, international institutions, media organisations and civil society.\n Copyright 2017 Emirates News Agency (WAM) Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

The agreement was modest in its ambition, since it required each country to state its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to reducing carbon emissions, and then subject such voluntary commitments to international scrutiny. \n\nThe prevarication by the US, which was the top polluter till China replaced it a few years ago, will obscure the basic dichotomy in climate negotiations between industrial and developing countries. The former was responsible for the problem by burning fossil fuels at an alarming rate, while the later is paying the price for it. What is more, as the late Anil Agarwal of the Delhi-based think-tank, Centre for Science & Environment, argued in the early 1990s, there is a distinction between the "historical" emissions of industrial countries and "survival" emissions of developing countries. \n\nUS official sources, using UN data, show that the average American emitted 16.4 tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2013, as opposed to 7.6 tonnes by a Chinese and only 1.6 tonnes by an Indian. Gulf states fared worst, with Qatar registering 40.5 tonnes, and Kuwait 27.3 tonnes. If one takes the global ecological footprint, which is the amount of land and water that each person occupies to source one\'s natural resources, the UAE also fares badly, since it obtains these from other countries. \n\nDuring UN climate negotiations, beginning with the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities" for tackling climate change between developed and poor countries was firmly established, but is being gradually watered down by the former. Basically, they want all countries to take action to mitigate the consequences of climate change, rather than adapt to it as the global South has to do. \n\nThe Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) in Mumbai holds an annual climate conference, where it has been putting forward the concept of a \'carbon budget\'. This is the amount of emissions that industrial versus developing countries have to avert catastrophic climate change from crossing two degrees Celsius. Between 2012 and 2100, this will amount to a total of 270 Gigatonnes of carbon (Gtc). Forgetting about historical emissions and simply dividing this budget between all countries on a per capita basis, industrial countries have only 50 Gtc left. If one takes the pledge made by June 2015, including the pre-2020 commitments and the INDCs (mostly till 2030), when TISS held its meet before the Paris conclave, developed countries will be emitting 51Gtc between 2012 and 2030 itself. As TISS argues, "So the budget that is available to industrial countries for the duration of 88 years will be exhausted in a span of 18 years. \n\n"These countries will therefore consume more than their per capita share of the future carbon budget (as they have already done for the cumulative carbon dioxide emitted in the past). This would mean that either the developing countries will have to undertake mitigation burdens that are inequitably large, or the world will have to face a maximum temperature increase of more than two degrees Celsius - the burden of which will also fall on developing countries." \n\nThe notion of equity therefore is the bedrock of climate negotiations, which is now being abandoned in favour of a one-size-fits-all approach. What is more, the equity should be operationalised, and not just mouthed as rhetoric, in the formulation and implementation of post-Paris goals. \n\nIn 1991, Agarwal and Sunita Narain titled their startling treatise \'Global Warming in an Unequal World: A Case of Environmental Colonialism\'. This rebutted calculations by the Washington-based World Resources Institute that China and India figured among the top five emitters in the world. It pointed to the flaws in these estimates as well as the omission of historical emissions in the US institute\'s calculus. Instead, it for the first time posed the more telling alternative - per capita emissions, which tell an entirely different story. Thus, while China figures at the top of the world\'s emitters today, its per capita emissions is less than half of an American\'s. \n\nWhile pointing to the global inequality in climate negotiations, one should not fall into the trap of ignoring the inequalities within emerging countries like India. The emissions of some 300 million Indians will approximate developed countries\' levels and have to be reduced in order to establish a level playing field within the country. Otherwise, the poor will bear the burden of climate change - whether it is the searing heat of Phalodi in Rajasthan, which touched 51 degrees Celsius in 2016, or Anantapur in Andhra Pradesh, or floods in eastern India. \n\nA 2015 study titled \'Climate Change: A Risk Assessment\' by research agencies in the US, China, the UK and India in 2016, claimed that flooding in the Ganga basin could become six times more frequent by the end of this century. According to another 2015 study by the US-based National Centre for Atmospheric Research, soot or \'black carbon\' in peninsular India travels southwards from the northern plains, where poor households cook on smoky wood stoves. This carbon constitutes nearly one-tenth of the finest measurable particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less, which lodges itself in one\'s lungs and causes severe impairment. Besides, when these pollutants are wafted on to the Himalayan slopes, they accentuate snow melt with floods alternating with drought in the Indo-Gangetic belt. \n\nThere is thus a strong case for helping poor households in northern India switch to cleaner fuels like LPG, as well as solar energy. Indeed, this presents India with the opportunity to develop its renewable energy industry, a market which is expected to touch US$6 trillion by 2030. China is emerging as the leader, but India could well have a toe in the door with its International Solar Alliance, which was unveiled in Paris two years ago. \n\nThe author is Chairperson, Forum of Environmental Journalists of India (FEJI) \n\nCredit:Darryl D\'Monte \n'b'Publication: The Daily Campus, University of Connecticut, Storrs CT.\nThere was a presentation by the U.S. delegates advocating clean coal, Wanjiku Gatheru, a third-semester environmental studies major who attended the climate meeting, said. (COP23/Twitter)\nStaff and students from the University of Connecticut recently connected with people from around the world at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  meeting, the 23rd Conference of the Parties (COP23), in an effort to confront climate change.\nThe students and staff were part of a group called UConn@COP, a group of environmental advocates dedicated to attending the annual COP meetings.\nThis years event was hosted by Fiji, in the city of Bonn, Germany from Nov. 11 to Nov. 18 in, to advance the aims and ambitions of the Paris Agreement and achieve progress on its implementation guidelines, according to the UNFCCC website.\nWhile President Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, it takes four years to officially withdraw, so the U.S. is required to have representation at the convention for the next three years, Sarah Munro, the Sustainability Program Coordinator for the Office of Environmental Policy , said.\nThere was a presentation by the U.S. delegates advocating clean coal, Wanjiku Gatheru, a third-semester environmental studies major who attended the climate meeting, said. A group of people from SustainUS and the NAACP showed up early to the talk, filling the space, and started singing as a peaceful protest that made national news, Gatheru said.\nWe Are Still In , people and corporations from the U.S. who have agreed to uphold the standards of the Paris Agreement, set up a big white blow up tent, Caroline Anastasia, fifth-semester chemistry major who attended the climate meeting, said. It was entirely funded by sub-national governments, organizations and businesses including Coca Cola and the Mars candy company.\nThat was encouraging to see that even though the federal administration doesnt care anymore that other people still do, Anastasia said.\nAlthough UConn@COP as a group did not have access to the location of the U.S. delegation, a professor from UConn was able to see what U.S. representation looked like and took a photo, Anastasia said. Whereas other countries had big pavilions, the presence of the United States was literally one door that was closed in the back corner of the area, Anastasia said.\nUConn hosted a networking night with Tufts University, Second Nature and the Association for the Enhancement of Sustainability in Higher Education, an event that included over 200 people, Anastasia said.\nMunro said students were also able to experience a wide variety of perspectives within their own group from UConn.\nThis year (UConn@COP) had one of the most widespread and diverse groups that weve ever had, Munro said. I think that lent itself to some good insights that you wouldnt otherwise get in a course where youre just taking it with fellow political scientists or fellow engineers.\nThere were disagreements on what the priorities of climate change action should be, Katie Main, a seventh-semester Environmental Engineering major who attended the climate meeting, said. Everyone prioritizes the branch of environmental change they study, Main said.\nThe fact that 14 students couldnt agree on a solution explains why the whole world cant, Main said.\nThere were students from all disciplines that allowed for different ideas for solutions, Gatheru said.\nI think were like minded in our love for the environment but how we love the environment is completely different, Gatheru said.\nLast year, UConn@COP met with President Herbst when they returned to discuss their experience and what plans they can implement at UConn to create a more sustainable campus, Munro said.\nThis year, UConn@COP has not had a chance to talk to President Herbst yet, Munro said. The group is working on plans for attending COP24 as well as the 2018 Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco Calif, Munro said.\nThats another thing that were looking at and saying okay how can we really act as a leader, Munro said. Especially in these next couple very critical years. \nCredit: Nicholas Hampton\n'b'A group of Democratic leaders used yesterdays United Nations climate summit in Bonn, Germany as an opportunity to show that the rest of the U.S. has a different stance on climate change than its commander-in-chief. The two-week Bonn Climate Conference, which began on November 6th, assembled to outline a plan for the pledges expressed in the Paris Climate Change Accord and accomplish the task of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees by 2100.\nBeginning at the conference last week, U.S. Democratic senators began engaging in talks with global leaders in an attempt to minimize Donald Trumps remarks on the subject. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and environmentalist Tom Steyer helped cover the cost of a $235,000 pavilion, boasting top speakers and brandishing the slogan, Were still in. Steyer is also known for spending millions on a national ads outlining reasons to impeach Donald Trump. Democratic senators are also getting in on the action. I want to make it clear: The federal government is not just the president of the United States, said Senator Ben Cardin (D-Maryland) before a crowd of cheering activists at the pavilion.\nStarting late last week, U.S. senators began talks with delegations from India and Japan. They reportedly have additional talks scheduled with the European Union, Mexico, Indonesia and Canada.\nThe highly organized succession of anti-Trump rhetoric displayed by Democrats at the Bonn Summit circle around the idea of using the United States governments notoriously slow turnaround process to their advantage. Although Republicans control the White House and the majority of Congress, they need 60 votes to succeed in their legislative goal of reversing Obama-era climate initiatives such as placing carbon limits on the power industry, maintaining fuel economy standards and placing tax credits on wind and solar energy.\nI think that theres an understanding of the American system of government, which is sometimes cumbersome and slow, and frustratingly so, but in this instance it works in favor of climate action, said Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii). Whatever the presidents rhetoric, he cant prevent us from moving forward on clean energy.\nDemocrats are using the Bonn Summit as an opportunity to rebuild international faith in the United States dedication to curb emissions despite Trumps aggressive tirade against it.\n\nFrancesca Friday is New York City-based National Politics contributor for Observer.

In a sharp referral to Trump\'s "Make America Great Again," Marcon granted a EUR 60 million fund to 18 scientists, 13 of which are American, to counter Trump\'s policy in the environmental scene.\nEarly June, President Trump announced that he would withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement, which in his words is a "hoax." The decision set off worldwide criticism and condemnation.\nMacron took the matter to heart. Soon after the U.S announcement he hurled into a social media campaign, offering a "second home" to American scientists concerned about the political climate and global warming.\nFrance also unveiled that it was offering 3- to 5-year grants, worth up to EUR 1.5 million, appealing to 50 foreign climate scientists. The "Make Our Planet Great Again" has now amounted to EUR 60 million in direct funding and in-kind support, reported Sciencemag.\nOn the eve of the Climate Change, Macron announced the names of the 18 scientists who won the bid. The list includes prominent names, including climate researcher Camille Parmesan, who was granted a share of the 2007 Nobel Prize for her contribution to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nThough the list includes names from India, Europe, and Canada, many of the winners work at academic or federal government laboratories in the United States.\nMacron\'s initiative "gave me such a psychological boost, to have that kind of support, to have the head of state saying I value what you do," said Parmesan, from the University of Texas.\n"It can be embarrassing to try and explain what is going on at home right now," said Louis A. Derry, a professor of Earth and atmospheric sciences at Cornell University in New York.\n"For me, the chance to work on some very exciting science questions with my French colleagues and not be so dependent on the crazy stuff that goes on in Congress and with the current administration is honestly very attractive," he added.\nMore than 50 world leaders will be today in Paris for the One Planet Summit. Trump was not invited.\nJointly organized by France, the United Nations, and the World Bank in partnership with non-governmental organisations, the summit will mark the second anniversary of the adoption of the Paris Agreement.\nThemed "Climate Change Financing," the main focus of the summit is to take further action on climate, notably on the financial front to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement both in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and protecting the environment of populations in the face of the consequences of climate change.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Morocco World News.\nFor any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at content.services@htlive.com\n'b'Academics fear Donald Trump\'s environmental policy may put an end to key data from US agencies\nUK scientists are warning they may be unable to carry out crucial research on climate change if Donald Trump cuts climate science funding in the US.\nTrump tweeted in 2014 that research on global warming is "very expensive bullshit" that "has to stop". Scientists are braced to find out whether his administration will put these words into practice. The early signs are not good. Last month Scott Pruitt, one of the US Environmental Protection Agency\'s fiercest critics, was named as its new head. There are rumours that the budget of its office for research could be cut by more than 40% as part of extensive overall cuts.\nMeanwhile there are reports that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), one of America\'s leading climate science agencies, could have its budget cut by nearly 20%. The agency\'s satellite division, a vital source of data for climate research, is expected to bear the brunt of cuts.\nBritish scientists say moves to squeeze funding of climate-related research in the US -- and of facilities at government laboratories in particular -- could be disastrous for work in the UK. And they say Trump\'s travel ban is already harming their collaboration with scientists in America, with some researchers pulling out of commitments in the UK because of fears they may not make it back through US visa controls.\nProf Joanna Haigh, co-director of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London, says: "Everything we do is international, and we particularly rely on American satellite data. Perhaps we could manage if other areas were cut -- perhaps the Chinese or the Indians might even step in to fill the gaps -- but we would definitely miss the satellite data from the US."\nHaigh uses satellite data to study how the sun influences the Earth\'s climate. She is helping to disentangle the effect of natural fluctuations in solar energy from those of manmade greenhouse gases -- and she is clear that global warming cannot be attributed to the sun or other natural processes.\n"At Imperial we use NOAA satellite data for many important climate studies. For example, it can tell us how much of the sun\'s energy the Earth absorbs, how much heat energy it emits and how these values depend on other factors, particularly cloud cover."\nShe says cutting the NOAA\'s budget would be a "huge hit" not only for science, but also for our understanding of the weather. "They are trying to get rid of everything that could be badged as climate change. But to understand the climate you need to measure the weather. You can\'t separate the two. Whether you are on a climate change \'bandwagon\' is irrelevant."\nProf Piers Forster, director of the Priestley International Centre for Climate at Leeds University, says: "If organisations like Nasa and the NOAA are prohibited from putting up new satellites, that could be really detrimental for the entire international science community. We urgently need these data sets to be able to monitor and understand climate change."\nLike many scientists Forster fears a cull across a number of US government laboratories concerned with climate change. "Our one biggest concern is the loss of raw talent," he says. "The loss of people we collaborate with and the people producing this data that we rely on."\nHe says the Trump administration is already making scientific collaboration across the Atlantic more difficult. "Quite a lot of the academics we work with in America are immigrants and some of them are concerned about leaving the country in case they don\'t get back in. We\'ve certainly seen instances where people have pulled out of coming to scientific conferences. Four or five people I know of, speakers and so forth, have pulled out of their commitments to come here."\nIn a recent example a key scientist from Princeton University pulled out of a climate change workshop that Forster co-organised at Imperial College London.\nAmerican research fellow Dr Sarah Batterman moved to Leeds University to work on tropical forests and climate change a year ago after doing postdoctoral research at Princeton. She is in regular contact with colleagues in the US and says: "The situation for people doing climate-related science in the US is really scary. There is so much uncertainty. I think people are trying to keep their heads down and keep their research going as much as they can until they see what is going to happen."\nBatterman works closely with scientists at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, a US government laboratory in Panama, and is concerned about whether its funding will continue. "My research wouldn\'t be possible without the Smithsonian facilities. So for me this isn\'t just something that is happening at a distance," she explains.\nFor Prof Rosalind Cornforth, director of the Walker Institute at Reading University, the anxiety about the US pulling the plug on climate science is somewhat different. Her institute works with governments and scientists in some of the world\'s most fragile, conflict-affected countries, applying climate science to solve real-world problems.\n"So many of our fellow climate scientists from developing countries rely on access to climate data sets available in the US," she says. "If these become restricted in the future, there would be repercussions on vital capacity development for places like Africa."\nThere is one potential silver lining for UK universities in this cloud of uncertainty. Vice-chancellors at some leading universities said last week they hoped to be able to woo some big-name climate scientists from across the Atlantic.\nForster, whose institute is only a year old and is recruiting staff, says: "I have just got back from a trip to America to talk to people. Many scientists think it is too early to leave. They don\'t know quite what Trump will do, and there is even some optimism that perhaps he won\'t survive a four-year term. But they are definitely interested in talking to us about possibilities."\nProf Paul Ekins, director of University College London\'s Institute for Sustainable Resources, says many climate scientists may feel forced to leave the US if conditions worsen. "If you are in a science field that depends on expensive equipment, like climate science research from space, and you can\'t get that kit because the funding dries up, you can\'t do anything. This is applied, practical work trying to understand what is happening to the climate. US scientists may well hope that things will change with the future administration, but they may not want to write off four to eight years of their productive lives."\nHowever, some climate scientists point out that with Brexit looming Britain may struggle to present itself as a place of calm and stability from which to escape Trump.

She had previously questioned the safety of vaccines and the evidence that human activity was causing global warming, both widely held views in the scientific community. \nA national survey last year by researchers at George Mason University in Virginia found that just 46 percent of broadcast meteorologists said they believed that climate change over the past 50 years has been "primarily or entirely" the result of human activity. By contrast, surveys of climate scientists have found that 97 percent attribute warming to human activity. \n"Weather forecasters are people, too, and their political ideology plays a role in their views," said Ed Maibach, who directs the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason and oversaw the study. "So conservative forecasters tend to be more skeptical than liberal forecasters." \nAmong those skeptics is Tim Kelley, who has issued weather forecasts on New England Cable News (NECN) since 1992. \nKelley describes himself as a "student of climate change," but says his experience with the variability of computer models has made him skeptical that anyone can predict how greenhouse gases will change the environment in the coming decades. \n"How can their computer models be better than ours?" he said. "We look at computer projections all the time, and we know how off they can be." \nKelley acknowledges the climate is changing, but like many skeptics questions whether rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is the reason. He believes most of the changes are natural, not man-made. \n"I\'m much less alarmed by global warming than most people," he said. "I\'d rather it be warmer." \nKelley said he was deeply concerned by Michaels\' apparent firing. \n"It\'s alarming that you can be scapegoated or branded as a denier," he said. Officials at WGHB didn\'t return messages seeking comment. \nMaibach, whose study was funded by the National Science Foundation, said that 99 percent of the 646 broadcast meteorologists he surveyed acknowledged that the earth\'s climate is changing. \nWhile many meteorologists are unconvinced about climate change, the profession as a whole has grown more accepting of the scientific consensus on climate change, surveys show. A study he just completed, though not yet published, found an increase in the percentage of meteorologists that attributed climate change to human activity. \nIn a separate survey of members of the American Meteorological Society, Maibach found that 67 percent said they thought climate change is entirely, largely, or mostly caused by human activity. About 20 percent of the group\'s members work for broadcast stations. \nDespite the shift, environmental advocates are disturbed about the sizeable ranks of broadcast meteorologists who remain skeptics, particularly given their public influence. \n"It\'s definitely concerning," said Bernadette Woods Placky, director of Climate Matters, a New Jersey program that seeks to help meteorologists reflect climate change in their reports. The group provides broadcast-ready graphics and educational materials to 375 of the nation\'s 2,200 TV meteorologists. \nPlacky said she tells skeptics that there\'s a vast difference in the data that weather forecasters and climate scientists use in their computer models. Unlike weather forecasts, climate models are far broader in scope, she said. \n"There\'s a lot of misinformation out in the public, and meteorologists have a lot going on," she said. "But they should know that climate models take into account the entire climate system." \nPaul Gross, a meteorologist with WDIV-TV in Detroit for the past 34 years, said he tries to help viewers understand that while weather is a reflection of day-to-day changes, climate change is caused by the slow accumulation of those changes over time. \n"Weather is the little picture; climate is the big picture," he said. "This shouldn\'t be a politically motivated conversation that seeks to confuse the public." \nRob Eicher, a former weekend meteorologist at WHDH-TV in Boston, said viewers shouldn\'t put too much stock in weather forecasters\' views on climate change. \n"It\'s like asking a podiatrist for help when you have chest pains," he said. "It\'s a different specialty." \nHe also pointed to politics as the cause of many skeptical forecasters, especially those who work at stations run by right-leaning owners. \n"What people need to understand is that there\'s a completely different set of physics in understanding weather and climate changes," he said. "We can predict tides years and years in advance, but I can\'t tell you what the wave heights will be in a few days from now. Climate deals with much larger issues." \nDavid Abel can be reached at dabel@globe.com.

There are significant risks to property and infrastructure. the whole point [of the report] is to get ahead of those risks so we can anticipate and avoid those risks. Forewarned is forearmed".\nDespite making sobering reading, Shaw said the report gave New Zealand a "head start" adapting to climate change compared with other countries. It found "limited evidence" of the country being proactive in adapting to the threat of climate change, with many sectors left to work on their own in a mismatched framework of policies and legislation.\nDunedin Mayor Dave Cull, whose city was highlighted as being at risk of flooding, said Local Government NZ had called for central government to act for two or three years. He said: "You need to take leadership on this, you need to give us direction."\nCouncils needed to know who was responsible, where funding would come from, what the risks were and how they could respond to them, Cull said. Despite plentiful information on how the climate is changing, the report\'s authors found "no evidence that climate change risks to New Zealand have been reduced by the actions taken by central government".\nShaw released a stocktake report from the Climate Change Adaptation Technical Advisory Group, which was set up last year to advise the government on climate vulnerability.\nHe released long-delayed coastal hazards guidance for councils, outlining how local authorities should consider climate change in planning decisions.\nVictoria University climate scientist Judy Lawrence said a sea rise of just a few centimetres could tip coastal communities into taking "adaptive" planning.\nShaw warned that, in coming decades, parts of the country may become "uninsurable" as climate change effects filter through to premiums.\nThe report showed New Zealand has significant information about climate change, but not all was accessible or useful for decision making.\nIt found the government had been reactive, not proactive, in adapting to climate change. The authors criticised an "absence of co-ordinated leadership".\nClimate change will increase the frequency and intensity of extreme events such as flooding, drought and wildfires, which pose a threat to many communities, the report found.\nUnder a mid-range projection for rises in sea levels - 30cm within 50 years - a one-in-100 year inundation event would on average happen every year in Wellington, every second year in Dunedin, and every fourth year in Auckland.\nImpacts are likely to accelerate over time and extend across all sectors of society, including the economy, public health and biodiversity.\nOther risks include new, more serious diseases, with potentially more frequent pandemics, the report said.\nThere were likely to be significant impacts on the economy, including both tourism and agriculture, along with threats to low- lying infrastructure and communities.\nA "risk census" of infrastructure by Niwa in 2015 found billions of dollars of infrastructure was in low-lying areas that would be prone to flooding, including nearly 70,000 buildings and 2000km of road, with Christchurch and Hawke\'s Bay most at risk.\nA final report by the group, containing recommendations on how to adapt to climate change, is expected in March.\nCAPTION:\nCatastrophic flooding in Edgecumbe earlier this year.\nPicture: CHRIS MCKEEN/STUFF\nFrom left, Climate Change Minister James Shaw, NZ Climate Change Research Institute senior research fellow Judy Lawrence and Niwa programme leader Rob Bell.\nPicture: STUFF\nCREDIT: CHARLIE MITCHELL AND SIMON  MAUDE \n'b'REGION - Voices in Mayo are calling for stronger action on climate change and the call has gone to Canberra.\nMember for Mayo Rebekha Sharkie presented to Parliament in September the Multifaith Association of SA petition signed by the residents of Mayo and a banner calling for action.\n"This is part of a nationwide petition with some 25,000 signatures covering 90 electorates.There\'s no denying climate change. The science is in," Ms Sharkie said.\n"I think it\'s really important that we keep climate change on the parliamentary agenda. Climate change is the number one issue that concerns my Young Mayo group. So much so that in July we walked up Mount Barker Summit and unfurled a banner calling for action on climate change. The banner was created by members of Young Mayo.\n"Young people wrote messages to the Environment and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg, which I presented to him along with the petition."\nSome of the messages included, \'Can I please have the ability to breathe in the future?\' and \'For future generations please do something!\'\nThe petition demonstrates that climate change is a very important issue to the Australian community irrespective of your age according to Ms Sharkie.\nThe Principal Petitioner and a resident in the electorate of Mayo Philippa Rowland said the petition called on Ms Sharkie and all elected representatives to support stronger action on climate change.\n"We need a particular focus on protecting the most vulnerable communities here and overseas. We feel strongly that South Australia can lead the way," Mrs Rowland said.\n"The recent State Government decision to support the solar thermal project in Port Augusta shows that taking action on climate can provide new hope and create opportunities for new jobs. We want to see better Federal policies to protect our climate and embrace clean energy."\nThe petitions call for more urgent reductions to Australia\'s greenhouse gas emissions, a faster transition to a clean energy economy and more assistance for vulnerable nations grappling with the impacts of climate change.\nThe Young Mayo group has a strong voice on the protection of the environment.\n'b'A series of workshops are being held across Victoria, including Ballarat, to help organisations and businesses successfully apply for the state government\'s climate change innovation grants.\nThe Virtual Centre for Climate Change Innovation is running the climate change innovation marketplace events, which will come to Ballarat on Monday, October 9, at Oscar\'s Hotel and Cafe.\nSuccessful projects are set to receive between $50,000 and $300,000 in funding.\nProject manager Sarah Price said the workshop\'s key focuses would be to assist organisations in developing partnerships and projects to better tackle climate change and benefit from the funding opportunity.\n"These marketplace events are designed to actively promote ideas identification, dialogue and deliberation on the challenges of climate change and the potential for innovative solutions to these challenges," she said.\n"To assist with their application, we recommend that intending aspirants attend one of our climate change innovation marketplace events in either Ballarat or Horsham."\nMs Price said apart from a brief introduction to the grants, the content of the workshops would be entirely participant-driven and would present opportunities to discuss regional priorities.\nProject criteria for a successful application includes demonstrating innovative action to reduce emissions or manage the impacts of climate change, partnerships and collaboration between communities, government, business and research, and economic relevance to the Grampians region.\nMs Price said the VCCCI program was established to strengthen Victoria\'s role as a climate change leader and encourage businesses and organisations to help the state reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change.\nThe workshops held across major regional centres, including Ballarat, Bendigo, Gippsland, Warrnambool, Geelong, and Mildura, were one way of doing that.\nThe funding application deadline is November 30.\nFor more information on the grants or to register for the workshops visit climatechange.vic.gov.au/vccci.\n'b'Review US Chamber membership to show support for action against climate change\nReview US Chamber membership to show support for action against climate change\nThe worlds biggest miner BHP has said that it would leave the World Coal Association and review its membership of the US Chamber of Commerce to show support for action against climate change. The Anglo-Australian giant has been reviewing its industry group memberships to see if their stances align with its view that climate change must be tackled through reduction of emissions and the use of renewable energy.\nA 22-page report released on Tuesday found that the organisations as well as the Minerals Council of Australia held different positions from BHP, which derived just under 20 per cent of its total revenue from coal in the year ended June 2017. BHPs chief external affairs officer Geoff Healy said the report demonstrated the firms support for action on climate change and commitment to transparency.\nWhile we wont always agree with our industry associations, we will continue to call out material differences where they exist and we will take action where necessary, as we have done today, he said in a statement.\nClean energy target\nThe miner said it was making a preliminary decision to part ways with the World Coal Association (WCA), which would be reviewed by next March. The global lobby group had favoured the dumping of a clean energy target, which supports investment in renewables in Australia, since it instead preferred the use of cleaner coal technologies.\nIn contrast, BHP said its policy was to tackle climate change through encouraging the use of all technologies, rather than artificially favouring one -- such as cleaner coal -- over renewable energy. BHP said it also disagreed with the US Chamber of Commerces rejection of the Paris Agreement and a carbon-pricing policy, and would decide by March whether to leave the organisation.\nEmissions reductions are necessary to mitigate climate change, the report said, outlining BHPs stance in support of the Paris pact on cutting emissions. An effective global framework to reduce emissions should use a portfolio of complementary measures, including a price signal on carbon.\nParis deal\nThe Paris deal was sealed under US President Barack Obama, but his successor and climate sceptic Donald Trump pulled out of it in June.\nThe miner said its membership of the Minerals Council of Australia remains beneficial. But it threatened to quit the council unless it stopped lobbying for coal. Brynn OBrien, executive director of the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said BHPs decision to cut ties with the WCA is a seismic shift in the world of anti-climate lobbying.\nCredit: PTI\n'b'Secretary of Defense James Mattis has asserted that climate change is real, and a threat to American interests abroad and the Pentagons assets everywhere, a position that appears at odds with the views of the president who appointed him and many in the administration in which he serves.\nIn unpublished written testimony provided to the Senate Armed Services Committee after his confirmation hearing in January, Mattis said it was incumbent on the U.S. military to consider how changes like open-water routes in the thawing Arctic and drought in global trouble spots can pose challenges for troops and defense planners. He also stressed this is a real-time issue, not some distant what-if.\nClimate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today, Mattis said in written answers to questions posed after the public hearing by Democratic members of the committee. It is appropriate for the Combatant Commands to incorporate drivers of instability that impact the security environment in their areas into their planning.\nMattis has long espoused the position that the armed forces, for a host of reasons, need to cut dependence on fossil fuels and explore renewable energy where it makes sense. He had also, as commander of the U.S. Joint Forces Command in 2010, signed off on the Joint Operating Environment, which lists climate change as one of the security threats the military expected to confront over the next 25 years.\nBut Mattis written statements to the Senate committee are the first direct signal of his determination to recognize climate change as a member of the Trump administration charged with leading the countrys armed forces.\nThese remarks and others in the replies to senators could be a fresh indication of divisions or uncertainty within President Donald Trumps administration over how to balance the presidents desire to keep campaign pledges to kill Obama-era climate policies with the need to engage constructively with allies for whom climate has become a vital security issue.\nMattis statements on climate change, for instance, recognize the same body of science that Scott Pruitt, the new Environmental Protection Agency administrator, seems dead-set on rejecting. In a CNBC interview last Thursday, Pruitt rejected established science pointing to carbon dioxide as the main driver of recent global warming.\nMattis position also would appear to clash with some Trump administration budget plans, which, according to documents leaked recently to The Washington Post, include big cuts for the Commerce Departments oceanic and atmospheric research - much of it focused on tracking and understanding climate change.\nEven setting aside warming driven by accumulating carbon dioxide, its clear to a host of experts, including Dr. Will Happer, a Princeton physicist interviewed by Trump in January as a potential science adviser, that better monitoring and analysis of extreme conditions like drought is vital.\nMattis statements could hearten world leaders who have urged the Trump administration to remain engaged on addressing global warming. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is scheduled to meet Trump on Friday.\nSecurity questions related to rising seas and changing weather patterns in global trouble spots like the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa are one reason that global warming has become a focus in international diplomatic forums. On March 10, the United Nations Security Council was warned of imminent risk of famine in Yemen, Somalia and South Sudan.\nAs well, at a Munich meeting on international security issues last month, attended by Mattis and Vice President Mike Pence, European officials pushed back on demands that they spend more on defense, saying their investments in boosting resilience to climate hazards in poor regions of the world are as valuable to maintaining security as strong military forces.\n[Y]ou need the European Union, because when you invest in development, when you invest in the fight against climate change, you also invest in our own security, Federica Mogherini, the European Unions high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, said in a panel discussion.\nConcerns about the implications of global warming for national security have built within the Pentagon and national security circles for decades, including under both Bush administrations.\nA Physicist and Possible Adviser to Trump Describes His Love of Science, and CO2\nBrilliant and controversial, Dr. Will Happer of Princeton says being called a climate denier feels like being labeled a Nazi sympathizer. Read the story.\nIn September, acting on the basis of a National Intelligence Council report he commissioned, President Obama ordered more than a dozen federal agencies and offices, including the Defense Department, to ensure that climate change-related impacts are fully considered in the development of national security doctrine, policies, and plans.\nA related action plan was issued on Dec. 23, requiring those agencies to create a Climate and National Security Working Group within 60 days, and for relevant agencies to create implementation plans in that same period.\nTheres no sign that any of this has been done.\nWhether the inaction is a function of the widespread gaps in political appointments at relevant agencies, institutional inertia or a policy directive from the Trump White House remains unclear.\nQueries to press offices at the White House and half a dozen of the involved agencies - including the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Defense, Department of Energy and Commerce Department - have not been answered. A State Department spokeswoman directed questions to the National Security Council and the White House, writing:\nWe refer you to the NSC for any additional information on the climate working group.\nMattis statements were submitted through a common practice at confirmation hearings in which senators pose questions for the record seeking more detail on a nominees stance on some issue.\nThe questions and answers spanned an array of issues, but five Democratic senators on the committee asked about climate change, according to a government official briefed in detail on the resulting 58-page document with the answers. The senators were Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking member, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\nExcerpts from Mattis written comments to the committee were in material provided to ProPublica by someone involved with coordinating efforts on climate change preparedness across more than a dozen government agencies, including the Defense Department. Senate staff confirmed their authenticity.\nDustin Walker, communications director for the Senate Armed Services Committee, said responses to individual senators follow-up questions are theirs to publish or not.\nHere are two of the climate questions from Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, with Mattis replies:\nShaheen: I understand that while you were commander of U.S. Joint Forces Command you signed off on a document called the Joint Operating Environment, which listed climate change as one of the security threats the military will face in the next quarter-century. Do you believe climate change is a security threat?\nMattis: Climate change can be a driver of instability and the Department of Defense must pay attention to potential adverse impacts generated by this phenomenon.\nShaheen: General Mattis, how should the military prepare to address this threat?\nMattis: As I noted above, climate change is a challenge that requires a broader, whole-of government response. If confirmed, I will ensure that the Department of Defense plays its appropriate role within such a response by addressing national security aspects.\nIn a reply to another question, Mattis said:\nI agree that the effects of a changing climate - such as increased maritime access to the Arctic, rising sea levels, desertification, among others - impact our security situation. I will ensure that the department continues to be prepared to conduct operations today and in the future, and that we are prepared to address the effects of a changing climate on our threat assessments, resources, and readiness.\nHeres some recommended reading for those seeking more depth:\n\nHeres How US Allies Are Trying to Convince Trump To Take Climate Change Seriously\n\n\nUN Dispatch, Feb. 22, 2017, by John Light\n\n\nMattis on Military Energy Strategy\n\n\nNew America, Jan. 13, 2017, by Sharon Burke\n\n\nClimate and Security Advisory Group: Briefing Book for a New Administration\n\n\nThe Center for Climate and Security, Nov. 14, 2017\n\n(The Center for Climate and Security also has a helpful chronology of U.S. defense and intelligence output on these intertwined issues.)\n\nA New Climate for Peace: Taking Action on Climate and Fragility Risks\n\n\nA 2015 report commissioned by the foreign ministers of the Group of Seven\n\n\nThe National Security Case for Funding the EPA\n\n\nThe Hill (opinion), March 11, 2017, by Sherri Goodman (a deputy undersecretary of defense from 1993 to 2001)\n\nAlso, I ran a discussion on the subject at the Washington offices of the Hoover Institution last month with retired Navy Admiral Gary Roughead, who was chief of naval operations from 2007 to 2011; Alice Hill, who directed work on the intersection of climate and national security policy at the National Security Council during the Obama administration; and David Slayton, a retired Navy officer who is now at Hoover tracking Arctic security and energy policy.

A family of four would receive about $2,000 the first year.- American companies exporting to countries that don\'t use similar carbon taxes would receive rebates on the taxes they pay. Also imports from such countries would have fees based on their carbon content.- Regulations would be reduced, the Clean Power Plan would be repealed.The bottom line: less government, more environmental protection and an economic boost to 70 percent of Americans.Think of this as a national insurance policy against the risks of climate change. As the carbon tax rises it would even help coal become more competitive through carbon capture and storage.Among the authors of this Climate Leadership Council are James Baker III, Treasury secretary for President Ronald Reagan and secretary of state for President George H. W. Bush; Henry Paulsen, Treasury secretary for President George W. Bush; and George Shultz, secretary of state for Reagan.POLLS SHOW SUPPORTVoters who supported Donald Trump for president also support dealing with climate, according to a national poll conducted for Yale University.- Almost 2 in 3 support taxing or regulating the emissions that lead to climate change.- More Trump voters (47 percent) agree that climate change is happening vs. those (30 percent) who do not.- And 3 in 4 Trump voters support using more renewable energy.DOUBTING THOMASEvery major scientific organization in the U.S. that involves climate scientists or meteorologists says man-made climate change is a fact.Opponents try to turn natural skepticism of science against itself, much like those who tried to battle against studies that showed that smoking causes cancer. This was described in the book "Merchants of Doubt."One skeptic who has become a convert saw for himself the melting ice shelves of Greenland.Andreas Muenchow, an oceanographer from the University of Delaware, studied the ice shelves, reported The Washington Post.The pools of melted ice were proof that something major is happening.Greenland is pouring 281 billion tons of ice into the ocean each year.After making scientific studies, Muenchow is convinced that this is not normal.MORE RECORD TEMPSThe United States is posting more record temperatures, reported The Washington Post.Every state and city in the lower 48 states posted warmer than normal temperatures last year. Only 2012 was warmer.Actually, the U.S. has posted 20 straight warmer-than-average years. This qualifies as the new normal."The breadth of the 2016 warmth is unparalleled in the nation\'s climate history," NOAA reported.Alaska recorded its warmest year on record for the third straight year with temperatures nearly 6 degrees above average.Meanwhile, the impact of this is chaos caused by climate change that could be seen by 19 floods in the U.S. last year, more than any in recorded history.Several extreme rainfall events once were classified as 1-in-1,000 year occurrences, except that in this new era they may not be so rare.There were four separate billion-dollar floods last year, twice the previous record.From a global perspective, we\'re breaking temperature records once every three years, reports NASA in The Guardian.What global warming does is add another layer of heat to naturally occurring events like the El Nino effect from the oceans.Today\'s El Ninos are hotter due to a warmer climate.Michael Mann, climate scientist at Penn State University, reported that about 75 percent of the warmth was due to human activity.Put another way, without man-made climate change, the amount of warming experienced last year has a 1 in a million chance, Mann said in The New York Times."The longer we deny and the less action we take," reported the Guardian, "the more extreme the consequences will be."As the renowned glaciologist Lonnie Thompson put it, \'The only question is how much we will mitigate, adapt and suffer.\'"Those are our choices. We owe it to our children and grandchildren to minimize the suffering in that equation.SOLAR JOBS ARE GROWING - Jobs in the renewable energy field are difficult to outsource.- Jobs in solar and wind power are growing at about 20 percent annually, 12 times faster than the U.S. economy, reports the Environmental Defense Fund.- Investments in renewable energy generate three times more jobs than fossil fuels.\n'b"For the Monitor\nAs spring unfolds in New Hampshire, there's a predictable shift in the ailments that bring children into my office every day. Alongside the general excitement about the warming weather and the spring greenery, I see firsthand that global climate change is already taking a toll on my young patients' health.\nOn March 15, 11 top U.S. medical societies announced the formation of a new organization, the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, made up of family physicians, pediatricians, obstetricians, allergists, internists and other medical experts. The group also presented a new report, Medical Alert! Climate Change is Harming Our Health, which includes scientific evidence and accounts from doctors who see climate change exacerbating a wide range of health issues, including: heart and lung diseases associated with air pollution and wildfires; heat-related health dangers; the spread of infectious disease; and flood and extreme weather-related physical and mental health problems.\nThe new report affirmed that climate change is a major health threat  and that children are especially vulnerable to these impacts. As a pediatrician and a mom, this is troubling to me. But it's not surprising.\nTake Lyme disease, which is highlighted in the report as a vector-borne disease that is exacerbated by climate change. I diagnose and treat many patients with Lyme disease, from toddlers to teenagers. I see ticks emerging well before spring and continue to see tick bites and Lyme disease into the winter. I spend a lot of time talking with worried parents about how to best avoid ticks, and the importance of checking for ticks and monitoring for signs of Lyme disease. Climate change is part of this problem, because rising temperatures have given deer ticks a more sustainable habitat here in the Granite State. We are already experiencing the northern range expansion of Lyme disease, right in our own backyards.\nAsthma is another example of how climate change will harm our kids. Despite our largely rural character, New Hampshire has high asthma rates. Nationally, 8.6 percent of children suffer from asthma, but in New Hampshire, 10.6 percent of our children have asthma. Asthma costs New Hampshire an estimated $188 million (in 2014 dollars) each year. These costs are due to direct medical costs and lost wages due to asthma-related absenteeism. Among children ages 0-17, costs for medical care and parents' lost wages are an estimated $32 million. An estimated 30 percent of these costs ($9.6 million) are attributable to outdoor air quality. Climate change stands to worsen this epidemic-scale health problem, because it will make smog, pollen season and heat waves worse. All of those things trigger asthma attacks.\nI routinely treat children who have asthma. I see that when smog or pollen levels are bad in my community, that makes my patients' symptoms worse, they miss more school and activities, and their parents miss work. We have to use additional or stronger medicine to control their disease. This creates a burden for the child and the family, and adds cost to medical care.\nI am also concerned about how a changing climate will affect the spread of mosquito-borne infections. With warmer temperatures upon us, I need to closely monitor and stay informed about existing viruses such as West Nile virus and Eastern equine encephalitis, as well as emerging mosquito-borne infections in our area. I talk with parents about avoiding mosquito bites and the risks and benefits of various repellants for children as well as balancing the important benefits of venturing outside.\nThese climate-related health concerns are interfering with my patients' ability to get outside and enjoy the spring. That's not just a superficial problem. It also impacts their overall wellness. Research suggests that active, outdoor play and exposure to nature helps improve our children's health and well-being. I want to see children outside, playing, experiencing the natural world and maintaining active lifestyles, while minimizing their exposure to harmful air pollutants and mosquito and tick-borne infections. It's part of my prescription for good health.\nAs a doctor, there are limited prevention measures and medications that I have to address the climate-related health problems I am seeing in my patients today. That's why, as a health care provider and a mom, I support a longer-term outlook to minimize these burdens in the future. I support bold solutions to the climate crisis, for the health and well-being of my children, and yours.\n(Dr. Elizabeth Cramer is a pediatrician  at Concord Pediatrics and is a member of Moms Clean Air Force.)\n"b'Despite the progress made on several technical fronts at the UNs climate summit in Marrakesh (COP22) last November, a deadlock persists over climate finance which, despite several international commitments remains marginal to global capital flows. Urgent action is needed not only to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but also to help countries become resilient to adverse climate change impacts. Developed countries, however, are fiscally constrained and momentum is gathering around the need to mobilise private and institutional finance in meeting the commitment of $100 billion a year for adaptation and resilience in the developing world.\nThe World Bank estimates that some $158 trillion worth assets - double the total output of global economy - could be in jeopardy without preventable action. Understanding climate risks therefore is vital to ensure capital is allocated efficiently and optimally.\nGround report\nMany actions to improve climate resilience take place within local markets where there is a supply and demand for products and solutions that protect assets from climate risks - such as water-efficient irrigation technologies, storm resilient building materials, water harvesting services, flood control, climate resilient crops and seeds. However, these private transactions are rarely accounted for under labels such as climate resilience or climate adaptation.\nNor are the local financial markets, in developing countries, deep and robust enough to offer a broad range of financial instruments and products to support these transactions, leading to their imminent failure in securing viability-gap funding either from governments, or multilateral development banks. As much of these market activities related to climate resilience remains hidden in plain sight, products and solutions that help assets to adapt to climate risks, remain largely unrecognised.\nBeyond the obvious\nWhat is needed is a deeper understanding of the benefits offered by climate resilience to better inform business decisions regarding climate risk transfer schemes such as insurance. No industry has done more analysis on the issue of climate-related risks than the insurance sector, and promising models such as parametric insurance schemes are being piloted across the globe. But insurance against climate risks is prohibitively costly, unavailable or likely to disappear without a strong government support. Here the Government should intervene in facilitating privately-funded risk mitigation activities by establishing sound regulatory framework, and market- enabling policies.\nSuch regulations should help ensure solvency, while facilitating licensing, product innovation and reinsurance placement and international risk pooling and diversification. In addition, public vehicles can be efficiently designed to allow the private sector to insure a large portion of risk, while leaving only a residual risk (in very extreme circumstances) to public sector funding.\nProjects to adapt to climate change rarely offer a clear rate of return due to high upfront cost, a longer gestation period capacity constraints and technological limitations. Due attention should be given for improving capacity for bankable project development, implementation and monitoring, and evolving commonly acceptable technical standards.\nThe financial sector globally needs to develop markets for instruments to invest in resilience main streamed projects. Instruments such as catastrophe risk insurance, contingency fund, disaster-relief fund, restoration fund, contingent credit at preferential rate, micro-credits; climate bond, social protection-bond need to be soundly designed and rightly targeted to beneficiaries needs.\nWhere change is needed\nEven for the Indian State governments climate finance is evolving as an important avenue to finance their climate change action plan. However, climate finance, in its current form, is just the cumulative costs of projects identified under this plan, whereas technically it refers to the incremental cost of climate proofing of the investment that takes into account potential climate risks and, the costs of making the infrastructure more resilient to such risks.\nThus an analytical framework is necessary to combine potential climate risks with a systematic cost-benefit analysis which can help decision-makers prioritise adaptation measures. Favourable policy and institutional actions are important preconditions for successful introduction or scaling up of financial instruments. Such actions, through public-private partnership, can help tackle the underlying drivers of inadequate insurance, especially lack of risk awareness or experience with risk management products and practices; unaffordability, especially among lower-income households or small enterprises; and fundamental limits to insurability.\nContinued and careful use of donor support, such as for the initial capitalisation of risk pools may also be necessary to accelerate the closing of coverage and preparedness gaps. Policy actions need to focus on how the Government can encourage financiers and investor to take the long-term view on climate financing by harnessing the public balance sheet, market incentives, blended finance, environmental legislation, market coherence, encouraging cultural transformation and, enhanced information flows among the stakeholders.\nMajority of the capital intensive items in the State climate plans are mixed actions and contribute to conventional development activities. Examples include agricultural research and extension, irrigation, forestry conservation and urban infrastructure. So, a complementarity between climate finance and conventional development funding will have dual benefits, firstly by improving the quality of proposals for securing international funds and, secondly helping in better bargaining for the share of the State budget as the State budgeting process will assign higher priority to development actions that also deliver climate resilience.\nThe writer is a management consultant\n'b'BONN, GERMANY: At the end of the two weeks of talks, negotiators agreed to keep working through the year to be able to finalise by December 2018 the rulebook to implement the Paris Agreement. The task of ensuring the rules are finalized and accepted by all will rest on Poland, which will assume the chair of the UN-sponsored climate talks on December 29, 2018, which will be held in Katowice in Poland.\nTo ensure that the goals set for the 2018 talks are achieved, Poland has decided to work with Fiji, which was the chairing the talks in Bonn, and Morocco, which chaired climate talks in 2016. "We have maintained that there needs to be continuity in climate policy and that is what we were planning to do, " said Poland\'s Environment Minister Jan Szyszko.\nSpeaking exclusively to the ET, Poland\'s environment minister said that he and his team had informally reached out to Morocco and Fiji to work together. "There is good co-operation between Morocco, Fiji, and Poland," he said.\nThe task of finalising the rules for implementing the Paris Agreement began in Marakkech, Morocco in 2016, soon after the 2015 agreement came into force. Countries agreed that they would complete negotiating and finalise the rulebook by December 2018. Over the last two weeks, negotiators have been holding discussions on the various items that would be covered by rulebook.\nProgress has been uneven with the rule making process moving faster on some issues than others. Szyszko, however, is firm about the 2018 deadline for finalising the rules.  "That is my ambition and that is what the whole world is waiting for," he said when asked if he thought the rules would be finalized in Katowice next year.\nNeither Poland no Minister Szyszko are strangers to the UN climate talks. Poland has chaired the meeting thrice before--in 2018 summit in Katowice will be the fourth for the East European country. "Poland has a long history of creating the world\'s climate policies," said Szyszko, reminding that Poland chaired the meeting for the first time in 1999. "At that time, I served as the president of the conference," he said. The Polish Environment minister was Secretary of State in 1999 and served the chair of the 5th round of the UN-sponsored climate talks.\nSince then, Poland has chaired the talks in 2008, when the negotiations were held in Poznan and again in 2013 at Warsaw. The concept of national climate action plans, which form the core of collaborative effort enshrined in the Paris Agreement, was developed at the Warsaw round of talks in 2013.\nIn conducting the 2018 talks, Poland would like to cement its claim of being proactive on climate-related issues. "The efforts made by the Polish government to host the subsequent climate summits prove our involvement in actions towards climate protection Poland wishes to strengthen its position as a leader in climate policy in European Union," the minister said.\nPoland has been described as the laggard in addressing climate related issues. At the talks held over the past two weeks, observers from the European Union charged Poland with holding back on ratifying the Doha Amendments to the Kyoto Protocol.\nThe Polish minister felt that such a characterization was not fair or accurate. "I don\'t understand the noise all country are waiting for Poland," he said, adding "each EU member is completely free to ratify the Doha Amendment and they don\'t have to wait for the others."\nStressing on Poland\'s commitment to addressing climate change, the minister said, "Poland was the first country to ratify the Paris Agreement, before other members of the European Union".\nWith Poland hosting the climate talks next year, and given the increased focus on pre-2020 action, and the decision to hold during a Katowice talks a formal evaluation of climate action in this period, the pressure on Poland to ratify the amendment to 1997 legal agreement is high. "it is critical for Poland to ratify the Doha Amendment as soon as possible, unless it wants its presidency of the climate talks next year to look like a bad joke," said Iwo Los, climate campaigner, Greenpeace Poland.\nSzyszko said that Poland was in the process of ratifying the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol. "It is the priority. Right now the decision is in inter-services consultation. The next step will be consultation in the Parliament and signature of the President. We hope that these legislation processes end as soon as possible, in a fruitful way."\nThe expectation is that because Poland will chair the climate talks, this process would move at a faster pace. Observers say that ratifying the amendment would help Poland achieve its objectives at the Katowice talks. "Ratifying the amendments will also help build trust that developed countries are serious about their pre-2020 commitments," said Los.\n'b"KARACHI, March 16 -- The World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan (WWF-Pakistan) officially inaugurated Earth Hour (EH) 2017 at Alliance Francaise de Karachi on Wednesday by unveiling its celebrity ambassadors for the largest volunteer movement across the world.\nEH 2017 celebrities included renowned actor, model and documentary filmmaker Adnan Malik, popular VJ and model Anoushey Ashraf, and leading actor, radio host and singer Khalid Malik. The theme for the current year is 'shine a light on climate change'.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Ali Dehlavi, Regional Head of Sindh and Balochistan, WWF-Pakistan said that climate change poses a fundamental threat to everything around us. Melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and new and more frequent weather extremes such as heatwaves and super floods will leave no continent untouched. Referring to a study titled 'Climate Change Adaptation in the Indus Ecoregion' he shared that one of the key findings of the study was that climate change will likely have a large cost on agricultural productivity in Pakistan. In particular, by 2040 assuming a 0.5 Degrees Celsius increase in average nationwide temperatures, an 8-10 per cent loss is expected across all crops corresponding to PKR 30,000 per acre. He lamented shrinking water supplies, lowering crop yields, burning forests, and the increasing acidity of our oceans. 'This has huge implications for our livelihoods and human security, therefore, we need to take action against climate adaptation and mitigation,' he asserted.\nAdnan Malik said that Earth Hour gives people an opportunity to go beyond the usual limitations and look at the bigger picture before them. He discouraged the use of plastic bags and instead promoted reusable ones, such as those made from jute. He also shared that he joined this campaign to fulfil his part as a responsible global citizen and ignite a much-needed change, not only in the collective perception, but also through practical action. 'We must all come together to work for a better and healthy environment and make every possible effort to tackle this issue.'\nAnoushey Ashraf stated that climate change and environmental challenges are not prioritized in Pakistan. However, there is a dire need to create awareness among people about these issues. She was of the view that nature does not need humans, but humans need nature. Earth Hour is significant in the way that it brings the whole world together for one noble cause. People have started to realize that the environment has a huge impact on their lives and every positive step creates a long-term benefit for them and the world. She emphasized that every citizen should pledge to plant a tree and tackle climate change impacts.\nMalik said that switching off unnecessary lights for an hour may seem like a small act, but collectively the magnitude of this gesture is unimaginable. We need to conserve water resources in the country and adopt sustainable ways of living. He also shared that a commitment to Earth Hour enables us not only to express our concern for our planet, but to also let the world know that we stand together to find solutions to the rapidly escalating climate crisis. He emphasized the need to change the attitudes of people about the environment so that we leave a healthy planet for future generations. 'I hope that as an ambassador for Earth Hour 2017 and a goodwill ambassador for WWF-Pakistan, we can encourage and inspire the citizens of Pakistan to be a part of this global change and secure a better environment for ourselves and for future generations,' he affirmed.\nUmair Shahid, North Indian Ocean Coordinator, WWF-Pakistan said that amongst the many challenges that our country faces, biodiversity loss is one of them. He informed that change in temperature is affecting the sex ratio of the turtle population, however, there is lack of data regarding the impacts of climate change on the population of different species. He informed that drastic changing in weather patterns also are adversely impacting water bodies. We are championing this campaign to give a strong message to the world that Pakistan cares about its rich flora and fauna and is taking practical measures for its conservation. He also shared that in order to make a safer world, WWF-Pakistan is working with local communities, helping ecosystems adapt to rapid change, speeding up the renewable energy transition, and cutting the emissions that drive climate change. He hoped that more people will join them this year by switching off unnecessary lights and adopting a positive attitude towards mitigating the impacts of climate change.\nEarth Hour is the world's largest grassroots movement to combat climate change. It started from Sydney, Australia in 2007. It has grown to become a global movement that now involves every continent across the globe. Earth Hour invites people everywhere to voluntarily switch off all unnecessary lights for one hour as a symbolic act to show their commitment to saving the planet. In 2016 EH celebrations, 178 countries and territories participated with more than 400 iconic landmarks switched off lights, cementing their place as the largest grassroots campaign in history. EH 2017 will be observed on Saturday, 25 March from 8:30 PM to 9:30 PM all over the world.\nPublished by HT Syndication with permission from Daily Times.\nFor any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at htsyndication@hindustantimes.com\n"b'eThekwini Municipality is getting its ducks in a row to cope better with challenges posed by climate change.\nThis, after some businesses had taken legal action against the city for damages they suffered during the storm of October 10, Musa Mbhele, head of development planning for the City\'s managing and environment department told The Independent on Saturday yesterday.\n"Changing weather patterns such as drought and the floods of October 10 that led to eight people losing their lives are all visible impacts of climate change that we can see on a day to day basis," he said.\nThe City yesterday held meeting in a move to develop a strategy to deal with climate change. "But we shouldn\'t make it end at strategy level."\nMbhele described the meeting at the Elangeni hotel as "a joint sitting of the political arm of the municipality in terms of Durban Climate Change Strategy Committee and the  Durban Climate Change Technical Task Team, to make sure that we direct our budgets towards fighting climate change".\n'b'New York\'s attorney general alleged in court papers Friday that Exxon Mobil Corp. may have misled investors about how it accounts for the impact of climate change on its operations by using internal estimates that differed from its public statements.\nDisclosing for the first time some of the specific evidence his office has collected in its long-running probe of the oil giant, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman claimed he found documents and other information showing that Exxon\'s process for estimating the potential future costs of greenhouse gas regulations on its business "may be a sham."\nHe made the claims in a filing in New York state court seeking to compel Exxon to release additional documents and produce witnesses for the probe, which began in 2015. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is also examining Exxon\'s accounting practices and climate change disclosures.\nLegal wrangling in the case  has also played out in federal court, where Exxon has alleged that the investigation by Mr. Schneiderman, a Democrat, is politically motivated and driven by company antagonists. Mr. Schneiderman has denied such accusations.\nAn Exxon spokesman called the allegations "inaccurate and irresponsible" and said the company would respond in future court filings.\nExxon\'s "external statements have accurately described its use of a proxy cost of carbon, and the documents produced to the attorney general make this fact unmistakably clear," spokesman Scott Silvestri said in a statement.\nThe company, which has submitted nearly 3 million pages of documents in the case, has strongly defended its disclosures and said its accounting practices are legal.\nThe airing of certain specific evidence in the probe comes a day after President Donald Trump said he plans to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, a 2015 agreement by more than 190 nations to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions.\nIn the past year, Exxon has repeatedly voiced its support for the climate agreement, advocated for a carbon tax, added an environmental expert to its board and begun testing technology to reduce emissions at power plants.\nOn Wednesday, the company suffered a public rebuke on climate when 62% of votes cast by its shareholders backed a resolution  to pressure the company to share more information about how climate change and regulations could affect its business.\nAt the center of the claims the New York state prosecutor made Friday is one of Exxon\'s central assurances to investors on climate change risk: that since 2007, the company has included a "proxy cost of carbon" in its assessment of the viability of its oil and gas projects.\nThat is an estimate of how much governments around the world may charge Exxon or other companies or consumers for the carbon dioxide they emit, through a carbon tax or other emissions fees.\nSuch assessments can have a material impact on how an energy company values its assets. With a higher estimated cost of carbon, certain projects could become unprofitable, potentially requiring an accounting write down or recognition of losses on a company\'s books.\nMr. Schneiderman alleges that from 2010 to 2014, documents indicate the company used "secret, internal figures" that understated potential future costs from climate regulations, even while suggesting publicly that it used higher estimates.\nThe company said in a 2014 report that it applied a cost of $60 per ton of greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 to its projects in developed countries. The state prosecutor filed documents with the court Friday that appeared to show it actually used a price of $40 a ton internally.\nIn 2010, an Exxon employee identified as a corporate greenhouse gas manager said in an email that the $60 a ton figure used for Exxon\'s annual Energy Outlook was "more realistic," according to documents released with the filing.\nAnother email in 2011 suggests that former Chairman and Chief Executive Rex Tillerson, now the U.S. Secretary of State, was aware of the discrepancy between internal and external figures. In part, Exxon was seeking to be "conservative" in its internal estimates, according to the documents.\nA State Department spokeswoman said questions about the probe should be directed to Exxon.\nThe company ended the practice of using different internal and external carbon cost estimates in 2014, the filing claims. Still, documents produced in the investigation don\'t show that the company has a consistent process for coming up with such estimates, according to the filing.\n"Exxon may still be in the midst of perpetrating an ongoing fraudulent scheme on investors and the public," Mr. Schneiderman wrote. He has broad powers to investigate allegations of corporate fraud and alleged wrongdoing under New York law.\nThe state accuses Exxon of failing to provide documents associated with an alias email account previously used by Mr. Tillerson under the name "Wayne Tracker." In addition, it adds a new allegation: that current Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods also had such an account, under the name "J.E. Gray."\nExxon has said in filings that it has complied with court orders and objects to overly broad requests for information.\nThe documents appear to include a rationale for Exxon\'s use of a different internal estimate for potential carbon costs: the sale of carbon credits. Exxon is involved in a number of projects in which carbon dioxide is captured and stored. Under some regulatory schemes, such operations can generate revenue if the party storing carbon can sell credits to other emitters.\nExxon this year wrote down the value of certain U.S. natural gas assets and removed more than 4 billion barrels of crude, mostly in Canada\'s oil sands, from its reserves total due to low prices.\nThe company has said its process of accounting for potential future climate costs helps ensure it will be prepared in the event that regulation or new technology slows demand for oil.\n"Whatever environment we find ourselves in, we will be competitively advantaged," Mr. Woods reiterated at the company\'s annual meeting Wednesday.\nWrite to Bradley Olson at  Bradley.Olson@wsj.com\nCredit: By Bradley Olson\n'b"Climate change is not a problem of the future, it is a problem that we are facing now. The decision for the US to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, as it is currently framed, weakens the efforts to combat climate change. \nWhile many South Africans may think it is a local US matter, it is not. South Africa and our neighbouring countries are already affected by climate change and both the practices on our continent and those in North America or Asia play a part. \nThe Paris Agreement is a hard-won pact within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) between 195 countries. Its intention is to bind the world community into battling rising temperatures - and the departure of the US as the planet's second-largest polluter is a major blow. \nThe withdrawal does not change the evidence regarding how our planet works. The effects are felt every day, in the form of health problems, environmental damage and a natural resource system that no longer meets human and wildlife needs. \nThe likelihood of more damage grows, thanks to the increasing population, rampant consumption habits and unsustainable water management. \nWe can't live without clean and abundant water supplies, yet climate change is already having weighty effects on the quality and availability of this precious resource. Many African countries are experiencing water stress as Africa becomes the third driest continent. \nExtreme water supply limitations have come into sharp focus in South Africa - and particularly for residents of Cape Town. The second biggest city in the country is now down to 500 million litres of water a day - a drop from 800 million litres before dam levels fell dramatically as the drought strengthens its hold. \nThe impact on food security is another concern. Many ecosystems have lost their resilience, threatening the survival and sustainability of the farming system. With the changes in season and the increase in water variability, it is expected that climate change will diminish productivity of cereal crops. This means that South African farmers will find it difficult to grow corn - a main feed source for livestock. \nIf all this isn't enough, climate change already contributes to the problem of disease and premature deaths worldwide, and this is projected to become worse over time. \nRising temperatures are expected to cause an increase in the prevalence and distribution of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and water-borne diseases. \nTragically, those who are least resilient to deal with detrimental effects of climate change are those with the least resources. South African communities, and especially women and children, are faced with this challenge. \nWe must step up ways to mitigate climate change by reducing emissions and helping the low-income earners, for example coal-mining communities, adapt to a new economy driven by renewable energies. \nClimate change sceptics dismiss credible independent studies which show that the concentration of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases have risen dramatically, at a completely unnatural rate, in the past 50 years. This is directly attributable to human activity. \nClimate change is real according to the vast majority of the world's highly capable scientific community. \nMajor economies all along the development spectrum - from Germany to China, India and Brazil - remain firmly committed to cutting emissions and expanding renewables as part of honouring their Paris pledges. \nMomentum is with us and progress will continue with or without the White House. \nAnd even without President Trump, progress is accelerating at the local, city, and state level in the US. More and more communities of all sizes from towns like Boulder, Colorado to major cities like Salt Lake City, Utah and Los Angeles, California, are committing to shift to 100% renewable electricity. \nCalifornia is breaking records for clean energy and working with states and provinces up and down the western hemisphere to cut emissions. \nAdditionally, some of the biggest advancements in technology over the past few years have come from trying to limit the main cause of climate change. \nRenewable energy, such as wind farms, solar panels and wave-energy converters, are great examples. These harness the power of nature in a clean way. But we urgently need lots more of this technology if we are to reduce our emissions. \nClimate change is an immense and complicated issue that won't go away on its own. Fortunately, there are ways individuals can make a difference. \nIt all starts with you acknowledging that it is an urgent issue because maintaining the environmental integrity is the responsibility of every individual within society. \nClimate change is about war and peace, human rights, poverty, hunger, immigration, health care and natural disasters and, in more ways than can be counted, climate change is about the economy. \nIt is causing immense human suffering and damage to the natural world. It threatens the collapse of civilisation in this century. Confronting this crisis is the great moral imperative of our time. \n* Hamilton is the branch manager of The African Climate Reality Project (ACRP), which is a branch of former US vice-president Al Gore's Climate Reality Project.\n"b'Climate change could become a "driver of poverty and inequality" and a threat to Australia\'s security if it is not addressed, a senate committee was told.\nThe call came as submissions closed for an inquiry examining the implications of climate change on national security.\nTasmanian Senator Jacqui Lambie sits on the committee and said defence had been proactive in the area, but needed to be better.\n"Defence needs to work more productively with local government and businesses in terms of defence procurement to ensure everyone is meeting environmental standards," she said.\n"I would like to see voluntary national service implemented to ensure when natural disasters strike, we have the numbers to support SES and the communities affected."\nThe inquiry will also investigate the capacity of national security agencies to respond to the risks of climate change, as well as the role of climate mitigation policies.\nThe Climate Council said in its submission to the inquiry that climate change posed a growing threat to human well-being, and would go on to put the Australian Defence Force under significant pressure.\n"These events affect individuals and societies through the displacement of people, damage to critical infrastructure, and damage to health and livelihoods," it said.\n"The ADF will increasingly be called upon to deliver humanitarian assistance in response to extreme weather and its impacts both at home and overseas."\nFormer Defence Force chief Chris Barrie said urgent action was needed to mitigate the "potentially disastrous consequences" of not taking action.\n"We are approaching a time soon when there will be a serious possibility that no amount of effort in deploying the limited resources we have available will be able to ameliorate the national security problems and challenges we are confronting," Admiral Barrie said.\nWorld Vision Australia recommended that a Climate Change Strategy for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade be developed and implemented.\n"The impact of climate change on vulnerable communities in the Asia-Pacific region is of concern to Australia, and left unaddressed will likely become a driver of poverty and inequality," it said.\n"Over time, this will have implications for the security and stability of Australia\'s region."\nCREDIT: Michelle

once Climate Change Action Committee with a new name, Sustainable Futures Committee.\n"Despite ill-informed and emotive exchanges from some councillors, common sense prevailed and sensible responses to 21st century issues are now on the table," Cr Gartner said.\nThe council will also move the $160 million in investments away from coal, oil, and gas.\n"This is a move that 30 other councils have taken," Cr Gartner said.\n"A move that is good for the council\'s finances and good for the climate."\nCr Gartner said they council would also actively seek out information and education so "renewable energy drives money savings and carbon emissions savings in our community".\n"Shoalhaven City Council\'s decision to divest its finances from fossil fuels makes both financial sense and is in line with community expectations about taking effective climate action," she said.\n"We know that our community believe climate change is happening and want to see action on the causes of climate change.\n"By moving any council investments away from funds that are investing in coal, oil and gas, we are directly tackling the biggest driver of climate change.\n"Divestment also makes good financial sense as fossil fuel assets pose the risk of becoming stranded assets in the near future."\n'b'CLIMATE change could serve as a wildcard for agriculture as the relatively uncharted element in an already full house of biosecurity risks.\nUniversity of Melbourne Primary Industries Climate Challenges Centre professor Tim Reeves said climate change would bring an added degree of difficulty to the already onerous task of biosecurity.\n"Climate change is really important when modelling likely incursions, and where and how they might spread," Professor Reeves said.\nWhile some good research is being done, climate change "brings a third element to the task", he says.\n"If we manage biosecurity with a steady as she goes, business-as-usual approach, it is highly unlikely to be satisfactory in the coming years," he said.\nResearch by the Australian Export Grains Innovation Centre found Australia\'s climate zones are moving south, shifting 100 kilometres to 400km since 2000.\nThe balance between summer and winter rainfall has been changed across the lower half of the continent by rising ocean warmth and altered barometric pressures in a warming atmosphere, AEGIC said.\nProf Reeve said extreme weather events caused by the changing climate could create risk, such as the spread of plants with high wind events, while changing rainfall patterns could alter the range of pests, bringing new biosecurity threats into particular regions.\n"It will impact on the number and type of exotic pests and diseases that can survive and thrive in certain regions," he said.\nCSIRO research director of health and biosecurity, managing invasive species and diseases, Andy Sheppard said climate change impacts to biosecurity were hypothetical, given the amount of hard evidence available.\nWhile "scaremongering" didn\'t help, and some impacts may even be beneficial to primary production, he said there was potential for damaging impacts.\n"Pest and disease impacts from northern Australia could spread south, particularly animal diseases," he said.\nMr Sheppard said while it was too early to make definitive judgment, limited research indicated the effectiveness for the biological control of the hated prickly pear, the larvae of the stem-boring cactoblastis moth, was breaking down and "may be due to climate change".\nMr Sheppard warned much of the government-funded research and development effort was directed at control and surveillance measures, as stipulated in the Agricultural Competitiveness White Paper.\nCREDIT: Mike Foley\n'b'Matt McGrath- BBC Environment correspondent\n"This is, I think, one of the most historic attacks on climate and environmental action that the US has ever seen," said Liz Perera from the Sierra Club.\nHer words are certain to cheer Trump supporters everywhere.\nGreen "job-killing" regulations limiting energy production have long been a red rag for Donald Trump, as candidate and President.\nHis new energy independence executive order seeks to radically change the US narrative on climate change, its causes and its importance. The best way of fighting global warming according to the new outline is to create prosperity. Environmental regulation should be about air and water. CO2, in this light, is your friend.\nSupporters believe that cutting back Obama climate regulations will create thousands of jobs in the newly liberated oil and gas industries.\nHis opponents agree the new order will be a job creator - but they\'ll be jobs for lawyers, not in the coal fields.\nFront and centre is practical action on the Clean Power Plan (CPP), the Obama project to cut fossil fuels from electricity production. Although it has long been tied up in the courts, the CPP will be left to fester there while the new administration comes up with a much weaker replacement.\n"Undoing the rule will not be straightforward," said Prof Bruce Huber, from the Notre Dame law school.\n"For the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to reverse course, it will have to propose a new rule, with all the lengthy procedures that entails. When President George W Bush tried to reverse course on some of President Clinton\'s signature environmental regulations, those efforts took years and were not entirely successful."\nIn terms of coal, the new executive order will allow the Department of the Interior to lift a moratorium on the sale of new coal leases on federal lands. However, boosting coal as a source of energy, and jobs, will be very difficult.\nMany coal plants have shut down not because of Obama\'s carbon restrictions but because of mercury pollution associated with burning the fuel. Thanks to fracking, cheap natural gas has soared as a source of power generation, and renewables are taking an every bigger share.\nFormer State department climate adviser Andrew Light now works for the World Resources Institute. Both of his grandfathers were coal miners.\n"They were paid by the tonne for the coal they pulled out of the ground, but those jobs are gone, and technology has moved beyond that and I hope it\'s the case that voters in the coal states will recognise that their jobs aren\'t magically coming back because of this executive order," he told BBC News.\nPresident Obama sought to put consideration of climate change at the heart of all government policy - but by revising the social cost of carbon measure and encouraging an immediate government review of all rules that inhibit energy production, President Trump is signalling a change in the widely held philosophy that CO2 is the enemy, the main driver of climate change.\nWhile rolling back Obama era ideas like the role of climate change in national security, or how climate change should be considered in relation to the National Environmental Policy Act, the Trump plan does not directly attack the key finding on which much of America\'s carbon restrictions are based.\nBack in 2007, the US Supreme Court ruled that carbon dioxide gas was a pollutant under the Clean Air Act.\nIn response, the EPA ruled in 2009 that CO2 and other gases were responsible for contributing to climate change which results in a threat to the public health and welfare of current and future generations.\nThis "endangerment finding" compels the federal government to regulate emissions of CO2. And according to some environmentalists, this finding is the solid rock that Trump\'s plans will be dashed against.\n"The law of the land is that CO2 endangers my public health and welfare," said Liz Perera from the Sierra Club.\n"So they have to regulate it. What they are doing now is saying that all the Obama regulations were wrong but that means they are going to have to put something forward in their place and by the law it has to be adequate or we can sue them every step of the way."\nOther experts believe that the ultimate goal of this executive order will be to overturn the Supreme Court ruling on CO2 as a pollutant.\nThey believe that the declaration of EPA administrator Scott Pruitt that CO2 was not a "primary contributor" to climate change is instructive of the direction of travel.\n"It is fundamental," said Andrew Light. "I believe that Scott Pruitt wants to go after the endangerment finding. Their argument is that climate change exists, but it is not the case that humans are causing it.\n"It is the endangerment finding that draws that tight connection between the fact that humans are making it and the fact that global warming is happening. Once you destabilise that point then you can go for the endangerment finding.

A U.S. withdrawal from the pact would cripple the most far-reaching effort  yet to curb temperature increases reshaping the world\'s climate, they warned.\nWhile the U.S. president hasn\'t moved to nix the global deal, Tuesday\'s executive order signals a White House push to render it obsolete by undoing local rules that would help America reach its targets.\nThe policy change also comes as longstanding U.S. partners fret over Mr. Trump\'s opposition to multilateral accords, with the U.S. president shelving, scraping or seeking to renegotiate trade deals , while rattling North Atlantic Treaty Organization members by raising questions about the military alliance .\nIn an effort to sell Mr. Trump on the benefit of clean-energy and climate-friendly policies, the EU has also been touting them as pro-business measures capable of transforming economies.\n"We see the Paris Agreement and the transition to a modern, more innovative economy as the growth engine of job creation, investment opportunities and economic prosperity," Mr. Caete said Tuesday, as he embarked on a trip to China, whose embrace of the climate-change pact is often cited as an example of its business allure by EU officials.\nIn a rebuke to Mr. Trump\'s push to reverse former President Barack Obama\'s policies, the EU\'s energy chief snubbed the U.S. for shirking its global role in climate change. Saying the world cannot operate in a vacuum on climate and clean-energy matters, he lauded China and the EU as flag-bearers.\n"The world can count on Europe to maintain global leadership in the fight against climate change," Mr. Caete said. "We will stand by Paris, we will defend Paris, and we will implement Paris."\nWrite to Emre Peker at  emre.peker@wsj.com\nRelated\n* Donald Trump Signs Order Rolling Back Obama\'s Climate-Change Rules\n* Despite Trump Move on Climate Change, Utilities\' Shift From Coal Is Set to Continue\n* Donald Trump\'s Victory Injects Uncertainty Into Climate Accord  (Nov. 9)\nCredit: By Emre Peker\n'b'George P. Shultz and James A. Baker ("We Thought We Would Hit Your Sweet Spot ," Letters, March 10) offer a lengthy polemic in apparent bewilderment as to why their tax scheme to cure a postulated "threat of climate change" was not better received. Climate change caused by carbon dioxide is assumed by the authors to be a global malady in need of a cure--their tax cure.\nScientists recognize that change is a normal attribute of climate on all geological time scales, yet a unique tax rate of $40 per ton of carbon (carbon dioxide) is claimed to cure "a potential threat of climate change." The authors assume that carbon dioxide is a prime driver of global climate but offer no proof. Dangerous anthropogenic climate change secondary to the burning of fossil fuels remains an unproved hypothesis, in spite of billions of dollars spent in the attempt. Years of claims of climate catastrophes that never come to realization and computer climate-modeling failures challenge the leading role given carbon dioxide in climate-change hypotheses.\nThe authors note that "energy producers support this notion" of a carbon tax. As any production costs or "carbon dioxide tax" are passed onto taxpayers and consumers, such producers have no reason to oppose it, and may well support it for public-relations reasons. Smoke-and-mirrors tax policies typically leave the taxpayer on the short end of the deal as those versed in government machinations well know. That is the real threat.\nCharles G. Battig, M.D.\nHouston\nThe trouble with the Shultz-Baker carbon tax proposal is that it is a purported solution to a nonexisting problem. There is no measurable evidence to back the hypothesis that man-made CO2 emissions will cause runaway global warming. At its very heart, that concept predicts that greenhouse warming will first show up circling the Earth in the troposphere over the equator. To the contrary, there is actual evidence based on 37 years of satellite measurements that no such warming has taken place. Without greenhouse warming in the troposphere, there is no basis for EPA regulation of CO2 emissions, and no need for a carbon tax or cap-and-trade tax. Remember, CO2 is not a pollutant under any definition.\nDonald G Eagling\nRetired Director of Facilities\nand Senior Staff Scientist\nLawrence Berkeley\nNational Laboratory\nDanville, Calif.\nMessrs. Shultz and Baker should Google "carbon dioxide." The first thing that comes up is "Carbon dioxide (chemical formula CO2) is a colorless and odorless gas that is vital to life on Earth" (Wikipedia). Contrary to the left\'s common mantra, it is not settled science on the extent of man\'s influence on global warming. To propose a tax on carbon dioxide, which they state in their letter, is to propose a tax on what humans exhale, which is also food for plants. There was a time when the Earth was much warmer and Greenland was green. And it is also a fact that the climate is always changing and more people on the Earth die from cold than from heat.\nA. Guy Hubschman\nAndover, Mass.\nTaxing the successful producers who have earned their money and redistributing it as welfare payments to those who haven\'t is what\'s wrong with the carbon-tax proposal because it punishes the good and rewards the undeserving. I implore the American people and politicians to fight against this altruism that is undermining the American principle that money is private property that morally belongs to the person who earned it.\nJim O\'Brien\nChagrin Falls, Ohio\n'b'The New York attorney general accused Exxon Mobil Corp. Monday of withholding documents from his office as it investigates whether the energy company misrepresented its understanding of climate change to investors and the public.\nLawyers for Attorney General Eric Schneiderman\'s office said in court documents that Exxon hadn\'t disclosed that Rex Tillerson, the former chairman and chief executive, used an alias email address to discuss risk-management issues related to climate change. Mr. Tillerson, now the U.S. secretary of state, used the pseudonym "Wayne Tracker" from at least 2008 to 2015, according to the attorney general.\n"Despite the company\'s incidental production of approximately 60 documents bearing the \'Wayne Tracker\' email address, neither Exxon nor its counsel have ever disclosed that this separate email account was a vehicle for Mr. Tillerson\'s relevant communications at Exxon," Senior Enforcement Counsel John Oleske said in a letter to New York Supreme Court Justice Barry Ostrager.\nExxon said in a statement it has provided more than 2.5 million pages of documents in response to a subpoena from Mr. Schneiderman\'s office, and will respond to the claims in court. The company acknowledged that Wayne.Tracker@exxonmobil.com address is part of the company\'s email system.\n"[It] was put in place for secure and expedited communications between select senior company officials and the former chairman for a broad range of business-related topics," the company said. But reports "indicating that emails to or from this address were exclusively climate-related are false."\nA spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman\'s office declined to comment. A State Department spokeswoman declined to comment.\nMr. Oleske said in the letter Monday that despite promising to "move heaven and earth" to comply with a subpoena, Exxon had withheld documents related to senior management, including from 34 email accounts assigned to top executives, board members and their assistants.\nThe New York attorney general and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are also investigating how Exxon values its assets in a world of increasing climate-change regulations, a probe that could have far-reaching consequences for the oil and gas industry.\nThe Irving, Texas-based company has played down questions about its modest asset write-downs, saying it is extremely conservative in booking the value of new fields and wells. In January, Exxon said it wrote down the value of more than $2 billion in U.S. assets, departing from decadeslong practice.\nIt is unclear at this stage what impact the investigations may have on Exxon, if any. Mr. Schneiderman has broad powers to investigate corporations under New York state\'s Martin Act, including civil and criminal claims against companies for securities violations.\nCredit: By Christopher M. Matthews and Erin Ailworth\n'b'Climate change negotiations are often fraught with tension. Developing countries want the developed world to pay for their carbon emission-fuelled industrial growth, while the US and Europe want emerging economies like India to commit to sustainable growth.\nCentral to this debate is how the developed countries should "pay" and one way is for them to provide funds to middle-income and low-income nations to mitigate and adapt to climate change. That, in a nutshell, is climate finance.\nThis may sound simple, but the reality is anything but. Despite the concept of climate finance being as old as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) itself, which turned 25 this June, experts are still grappling with what can be categorised under climate finance.\n"Developing countries have been pushing for climate finance to be defined, but developed countries have refused to be drawn into that debate," says Indrajit Bose, a senior climate change research officer at Third World Network, a non-governmental organisation (NGO). The ambiguity over its definition and the absence of compulsory reporting and rigorous accounting of funding have given critics of climate finance ample ammunition.\nGlobal public climate finance could be provided by dedicated climate funds or multilateral development banks (MDBs) like the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank, or bilaterally between countries. Nearly half of these are given as concessional loans and a tenth as grants. Liane Schalatek, associate director, Heinrich Bll Foundation North America, says there is a debate over whether loans which, even if low-cost, come with the obligation of repayment, should be accounted for in the same way as grants.\nA Billion Dollar Promise  \tIn 2014, according to a report by Climate Policy Initiative (CPI), climate finance flows totalled $391 billion, of which 38% was public money and the rest investments by the private sector in renewable energy. But of the total public climate finance, three-fourths were raised by countries domestically.\nWhile it is not clear how much of the total global finance has India received, of the $15.3 billion approved by climate funds, India has got approvals for over $1 billion, more than any other country, and the biggest projects are not surprisingly in the renewable energy sector. Gireesh Shrimali, India director at CPI, says countries prioritise climate goals differently. "In India, energy access and security is a priority. So much of India\'s climate plan is about scaling up renewable energy."\nIndia\'s per capita energy consumption is a third of the global average and nearly a fifth of its population does not have access to electricity. India accounted for well under a tenth of the world\'s carbon dioxide emissions in 2014. Two-thirds of India\'s installed power capacity is fossil fuel-based, but the Narendra Modi administration is keen on ramping up renewable energy generation.\nIt is targeting a capacity of 175 gigawatt by 2022, which is three times the current capacity. More importantly, the objective is to ensure that more than half of the targeted capacity is solar power, whose share in renewable energy is only 22.5% now. The government is providing subsidies of Rs 150 billion in the first phase under the National Solar Mission.\nClimate funds like the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Trust Fund, which was the first of its kind; the Adaptation Fund; and the Green Climate Fund (GCF) are under the UNFCCC. Climate Investment Funds (CIF), which includes the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), were set up by MDBs. The GCF is the world\'s largest fund, with donor pledges of $10.3 billion and the CTF the second biggest, with $5.6 billion.\nThe CTF has approved over $750 million for renewable energy projects in India. (China, the world\'s largest CO2 emitter, has not taken any money from CIF.) Jagjeet Singh Sareen, senior policy officer, CIF, says they usually finance an eighth of the project cost. The GCF has greenlit just one project in India, a groundwater recharge and solar micro irrigation initiative in Odisha. The GCF is financing $34 million of the total $166 million project cost, with the rest being footed by the state government and the World Bank.\nThe GCF and the GEF did not respond to requests for comment nor did Environment Ministry officials. The 2030 Water Resources Group (WRG), a partnership between MDBs, bilateral donors, private companies and NGOs, is helping Maharashtra secure $270 million financing from the GCF as part of a $1 billion project on climate-resilient agriculture, especially in the drought-prone Marathwada and Vidarbha regions. "We prefer projects that leverage private sector investment," says Bastiaan Mohrmann, 2030 WRG\'s co-lead for Asia.\nJairam Ramesh, former Union environment minister, while commending India\'s focus on renewables, believes dealing with climate change goes beyond that. As part of a landmark climate accord signed in Paris in October 2015, India agreed to reduce the volume of carbon emissions per unit of GDP by a third by 2030 from 2005 levels and said it would need $2.5 trillion for that and other mitigation and adaptation efforts. The Paris Agreement, as it has come to be known, aims to restrict the global temperature rise this century to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to strive to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nDeveloped countries agreed at the Copenhagen climate conference in 2009 to direct $100 billion in "new and additional" funds, both public and private, to developing countries by 2020. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2015 issued a report that said climate finance flows increased from $52 billion in 2013 to $62 billion in 2014.\nHome Finance  \tRamesh says India must invest in adaptation and mitigation on its own and not depend on international climate finance. If that is forthcoming, well and good, but we should not link domestic actions to availability of finance from abroad. We must make investments on our own, keeping in mind our unique vulnerabilities to climate change. India has had an action plan on climate change since 2008, which includes, besides the National Solar Mission, programmes to promote sustainable agriculture, water conservation and conservation of the Himalayan ecosystem, which had a budget of Rs 550 crore in the last five years, among others.\nIn the last fiscal, the Centre sanctioned Rs 251 crore for state government projects under the National Adaptation Fund (NAF). Mitigation deals with reducing greenhouse gas emissions and is mostly identified with renewable energy and energy efficiency. Adaptation, meanwhile, includes making agriculture climate-resilient and helping coastal communities deal with flooding caused by a rise in sea levels, among other objectives.\n"Adaptation is a matter of life and death for developing countries," says Bose. Climate financing till recently had a clear bias toward mitigation: in 2013 and 2014, 70% of climate change aid from climate funds and 82% of MDBs\' funding were directed to mitigation efforts, but that is changing, with more funds being made available for adaptation. While the stress on adaptation is welcome, there is still no consensus on how much money is actually flowing from the developed world to developing countries. The Indian government issued a scathing rebuttal to the OECD report in 2015.\n"Climate change finance flows need to be precisely that: measured flows, meaning, disbursed funds crossing borders. Not promises, pledges, or multi-year commitments about promised sums in the future. "It goes on to question redirection of funds meant for development purposes to climate change and the lack of verification of climate funding by MDBs. Developed countries do climate finance accounting the way the like. This raises the temperature in negotiation rooms," says a senior Indian government official dealing with climate finance, requesting anonymity, and with no pun intended.\nThe other major hurdle to climate finance is US President Donald Trump\'s threats to pull out of the Paris Agreement and his refusal to continue US contributions to climate funds; the US has pledged $5.8 billion to climate funds. While it has fulfilled its pledge to the CIF, it is unlikely to pay the remaining $2 billion of its $3 billion commitment to the GCF, according to Schalatek, but it is a matter of waiting out the Trump administration.\nSareen believes we need to keep in mind the campaign rhetoric of any election. The US hasn\'t withdrawn from the UNFCCC, and its financial obligations relate to the UNFCCC so its overall commitment stays. Climate finance, as outlined in the UNFCCC, is more essential for small, climatically vulnerable countries than India, which is better placed to mobilise domestic resources. But climate funding needs to be more transparent if it is to continue as a credible tool to fight climate change.\n'b'Publication: The Highlander, University of California - Riverside, Riverside CA.\nCourtesy of Pexels\nThis is a political year. That means everyone has opinions about where the world should be headed and how we should get there. No matter how weird this political season has been, there remains a key difference between opinions and facts. That difference comes into the starkest relief when people must face their own inconsistencies in reconciling the two domains. And nowhere is the gap between opinions and facts more apparent than the subject of climate change. Im talking about climate change deniers; people who benefit from science every day somehow manage to find a place in their heads to simultaneously reject it.\nThe facts of science  the facts of climate change  are in this day and age up for debate. But, science does not require belief to be true. Of course, everyone has a right to voice their opinion and debate, but climate science is not debatable any more than the temperature at which water boils is debatable. We have taken a proven scientific concept and convoluted it. President Donald Trump considers manmade climate change a hoax and therefore withdrew from the Paris climate accord. How did we get here? Just when did we begin to doubt the whole idea of climate change?\n25 years ago, climate science was not a political or economic subject  it certainly wasnt bipartisan. Republican President George H.W. Bush touted himself as being pro-environment. Im an environmentalist  And I always will be, he said in his pledge to reduce acid rain in 1988. And that is not inconsistent with being a businessman. Nor is it with being a conservative.\nBush signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  treaty at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio. But similar to the Paris Agreement, the UNFCCC treaty does not have any penalty in place if countries refuse to lower their carbon dioxide emission, it just acknowledges that climate change is real and everyone has to work together to solve it. Conversation about climate change began to take root in the US among academic circles. Then, all of a sudden, the fossil fuel industries chimed into the conversation and turned a scientific talk into an economic debate. They feared the possibility of putting limits on industry by requiring a reduction of carbon dioxide levels, which would mean people losing jobs and them losing money. At that point in the early 90s, there was a debate taking place where there shouldnt have been a debate at all. These industries started to bankroll think tanks and appeared in media to convince the public that the science behind climate change is wrong. Scientists were hired to haggle with any government climate regulations that negatively affected industry.\nSome of the hired scientist contrarians also worked for the tobacco industry back when the big companies were claiming that second-hand smoke was not bad for you. The same people returned for the climate change debate. The tricks that they learned from the tobacco industry was that you dont have to refute all the science; if you can just plant a little doubt or sow a little confusion and fear, it will take root and grow. This marked the birth of climate change denial.\nSo here we are today, having climate confusion in place of climate consensus. And it all started because science has often upset the establishment. Now the American people have voted in a leader who pulled out of a global negotiation to save the world from climate change  he reasons to put the country first, but in reality, he has put it at the back of the line in global progress. But here is the really difficult thing about denial for all of us: It always gets resolved in the end. Thats because when it comes to science denial, its reality that always has the last word.

The result is a brand-new series of books explaining everything  from evolution to quantum physics.\nIn November 30, 2015, the Prince of Wales addressed world leaders  at  the opening session of the climate change summit in Paris. For more than seven minutes, he stood at the podium flanked by the French and United Nations flags and talked of impending climate-change  catastrophes that will result in unimaginable amounts of upheaval and suffering around the globe, possibly in our lifetime.\nWe must act now, he said. The Prince has been trying to wake us up to the urgency of global warming for nearly five decades. But it is hard work getting people to care about climate change. It is too technical, too abstract, and too long-term.   The highest temperature ever recorded on earth was last summer: 54C in Kuwait.\nWatch | Paris climate summit: Prince Charles urges world leaders to think of their grandchildren                         01:37\nMaps projecting London in the future show the Houses of Parliament half submerged by rising sea levels from Greenlands melting ice cap - but most of us confine our environmental consciousness to the 10 minutes a week it takes  to sort out our recycling.

Why dont you produce a plain-English guide to the subject? The result is Climate Change by HRH The Prince of Wales, Tony Juniper and Emily Shuckburgh.\nIt is the first in a new series of Ladybird Expert Books on a range of subjects from the worlds of science, history and culture. The three launch titles - Climate Change (the only one with HRHs involvement), Evolution and Quantum Mechanics - will be followed in June by The Battle of Britain and Shackleton, with plans for two or three more a year thereafter. Prominent titles include Plate Tectonics and Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band.\nThe book uses vintage-style illustrations to highlight the possibility of global catastrophe Credit:      Ruth Palmer\nThe books have the same features as the iconic Ladybird books of our youth: pocket- sized, mini-hardback, lots of pictures (the first new illustrations in the Ladybird style for nearly 40 years), a maximum of 250 words a page in a round and friendly font. Except that instead of explaining large ideas to children, these books are aimed at grown-ups.\nLadybird has entered the adult market before, of course. A series of spoof books with such titles as The Hangover, Mindfulness and The Hipster, by the television-comedy writers Jason Hazeley and Joel Morris, took the brand in a new direction in 2015 and sold in excess of three million copies.  But the Expert series is not remotely funny.\nRather, the books provide a way into subjects that readers will be aware of but which they might struggle to explain, according to the publishers strategy.\nThe cover of the Prince of Waless bookCredit:      Ruth Palmer\nTalking to Penguin you also have the strong impression that the Expert series is a broadside against growing anti-expert rhetoric (People in this country have had enough of experts, said Michael Gove during the referendum campaign). The message of the series is that experts matter, and  its team of writers signifies serious intent.\nJim Al-Khalili, who wrote the guide to quantum mechanics, is a physicist, writer and broadcaster and has a PhD in theoretical nuclear physics. Tony Juniper, a campaigner and  environmentalist, is a fellow of the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership.\nEmily Shuckburgh is a climate scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.

I start teaching my first-year evolution course at UCL in January and I am going to use this as the course textbook.\nIn fact the Expert series was commissioned early last year, well before experts took a beating. But the timing is interesting.\nThe Ladybird Expert Book Climate Change illustrates why the ice caps are melting Credit:      Ruth Palmer\nWe have a US president who has said that nobody  really knows if climate change is real.

Juniper recalls. He wanted to present something everybody can read that cuts through some of the deliberately confusing misinformation thats been put out there over the years, which I know he is very frustrated about.\nI spoke to my wife the day the Prince phoned, he continues, and she said, Well, it sounds like a Ladybird book. So I wrote Prince Charles a note asking if he would like to explore that possibility and he said, Yes, lets try it.\nInstead of explaining large ideas to children, these books are aimed at grown-ups\nPenguin, coincidentally, was thinking of reviving the old-style informative Ladybird books. The Prince of Waless interest no  doubt had a galvanising effect. And the series was launched.\nHopefully the familiarity, strength and  resonance of that brand will carry some of these quite difficult subjects far and wide, says Juniper, who is happy to credit his choice of career to Ladybird books.\nHe says the Nature Series books Garden Birds and Sea and  Estuary Birds were very inspiring to a seven-year-old in Oxford. He still has the What to Look For In quartet - Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter - at home in Cambridge.\nOf course Climate Change looks simple  with a straightforward structure: what is  happening? Why is it happening? What can we do about it? But it required an extraordinarily complex degree of planning and organisation.\nIn quotes | Prince Charles\nJuniper and Shuckburgh, working mostly from her kitchen in Cambridge (they live within three minutes walk of each other), had the task of liaising with Clarence House, since the Princes role was to be deeply involved at every stage, right down to every single comma and full stop.\nHes been the real driving force all the way through, says Juniper.  It took several phone calls, for example, to fine-tune the artwork for the farming and solutions section.\nThe book is illustrated by Ruth Palmer in a beautiful, vintage-Ladybird style, and the image shows the benefits of a mixed farming system and increasing organic matter in soil with a bucolic scene of cows grazing on grassland and gulls swooping on newly ploughed earth.\nThe cover of Evolution by Steve Jones Credit:      Ruth Palmer\nHe briefed us very heavily on that one, says Juniper. He  spent a lot of time making sure we had the right kind of wild flowers in the field for the right time of year.  Shuckburgh says the book took nine  months and went through many, many, many revisions. These must be among the most thoroughly crawled-over 5,000 words in any book anywhere, says Juniper.\nThe question that puzzled me while scanning the launch titles was: why do we need a book on quantum mechanics?  I mean, climate change is obvious. The world does need to be better informed about the  climatic well-being of our planet.\nAnd evolution, too, is another priority, particularly as a Gallup poll in 2012 showed that 46 per  cent of Americans are creationists  who believe that the Bible is a book of history and that  evolution is a myth.\nI start teaching my first-year evolution course at UCL in January and I am going to use this as the course textbook\nIts clearly not the same as climate change, Jim Al-Khalili admits. I am not on a moral crusade. But I would say quantum mechanics is on a par with evolution. We wouldnt have health and medicine and agriculture without understanding Darwins theory of evolution . Similarly I wouldnt be talking to you on my mobile phone without quantum mechanics.\nNor would we have computers or lasers, or understand the nature of light. Besides, he adds, knowing a bit about quantum mechanics, which is the study of the very small, the  world of atoms, can make people feel cleverer. And if there is one thing hes learnt from presenting  Radio 4s The Life Scientific and TV documentaries, its people want to be made to feel clever.\n Quantum mechanics is so weird, and people love weird, whether its Harry Potter, or science fiction or magic tricks, he continues, and quantum theory is just so perplexing and people like that. Its one of those dinner-party  topics: did you know that an atom can be in two places at once?\nOne would hope that a copy will find its way into the Oval Office and that President Trump might be able to review his viewsTony Juniper\nHe says its also important to know what the future holds for us. Quantum mechanics is going to lead new technologies, he says. The first person who builds a working quantum computer will be able to decipher all our encrypted passwords and credit-card details on the internet.\nAl-Khalili read Ladybird books as a child, which is surprising as he grew up in Iraq. The family moved to the UK in the late 1970s, when Saddam Hussein came to power. It was his mother (who is British; his father is Iraqi) who introduced him to the books, and while he was in Iraq, his collection was boosted by parcels sent by his maternal grandmother.\nWatch | Prince Charles urges action against climate change 'before it is too late'                         05:39\nThere was also a British Council in Baghdad which had a library of English books, and there would be novels like Enid Blyton  but also non-fiction books, in particular Ladybird books. I was  into astronomy and space.\nLadybird books, however, did not feature in Steve Joness childhood in Aberystwyth . I was a Welsh speaker and couldnt really read English, and I was also a complete nerd. Mostly I read books about geology.\nWhy, I ask, should we read a book about  evolution? The most important thing is that its simple. And the second most important thing is that its fun, Jones replies. His book is a pared-down version of Darwins The Origin of Species. It begins with the revelation that whales are what became of hippo-like creatures that lived in the Himalayas 55 million years ago.\nThose ancestors, whose fossils are scattered across Everest, have done some brilliant remodelling over the ages and can now be found swimming deep in our oceans.\nThe other thing Im an expert in is sex, Jones continues, and I thought Id like to write the Ladybird book of sex. It would be the least erotic book ever written. It would be about inbreeding and the differences between males and females - I touch on it a bit in the evolution book - but the publishers said no. It was a Ladybird book too far for them.\nOf course my great hope is that people will see the title and assume its one of those parodies and buy it on those grounds alone, he laughs. I hope theyre not too disappointed.\nThe Ladybird Expert series launches on  Thursday, 7.99 each\nCredit: By Sally Williams\n"b"The project aims to mainstream climate resilience into government planning and address country priorities focusing on the most vulnerable sectors and communities, among others.\n The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government of Tonga today launched Tonga's first ever Climate Change Trust Fund.\n Siaosi Sovaleni, Tonga's Deputy Prime Minister, Lu'isa Tu'I'afitu Malolo, Tonga's Director of Climate Change, Feleti Fa'otusia, Climate Change Trust Fund Coordinator, and Tatafu Moeaki, ADB Senior Country Coordination Officer participated in the event. \n The Climate Change Trust Fund will enhance capacity for nationwide climate actions in Tonga by providing a sustainable funding mechanism, said Deputy Prime Minister Sovaleni at the launch.

Ayyappan, former chairman of NAAS, told reporters on Monday that the congress will come out with a Bengaluru declaration' on ways of making Indian agriculture climate smart. It is expected to become part of the policy initiatives of the Centre and various State governments, which are keenly looking at measures to ensure that food production is not affected due to the vagaries of weather.\nUAS-B Vice-chancellor H. Shivanna said the main theme has been divided into six sub-themes of climate change and variability, adaptations for climate change, mitigating its impact, farmers' innovative methods to mitigate climate change and capacity building for climate resilient agriculture & policy issues.\nThe idea is also to learn from the best practices in handling climate change in different parts of the country, he added.\nHe said there was a dire need to make agriculture climate smart as drastic changes in climate is threatening food security, especially when the country needed to sharply increase food production to feed the increasing population.\nCredit: Special Correspondent\n"b'Sometimes, plenty isn\'t good news. The people of Agartala, Bengaluru, Mumbai and Chandigarh would agree. In the past fortnight, each of these cities received in a day as much as 10 to 30 times the average daily rainfall, bringing them to a grinding halt. Mumbai was dumped with more than 200 mm of rain on Tuesday, which is 11 days of average monsoon rainfall for the city. It rained on Independence Day in Bengaluru and by mid-afternoon the city had rainfall of 128 mm, which is 37 times the average daily rainfall.\nNOT AN ODD HEAVY RAIN DAY  \tClimate scientists have long warned about changing rainfall patterns. The most recent report of the UN\'s climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, stressed the increased risk of flooding and alterations in rainfall patterns due to global warming. In India, studies show an increased clustering of days with high and prolonged rainfall.\nOver the past decade, India\'s rainfall pattern has changed. Instead of a steady monsoon season, there are greater incidences of high-intensity rainfall concentrated over a short period of time and geographical area. Despite excessive rains across the country over the past fortnight, the Indian Meteorological Department\'s data reveals that cumulative rainfall this monsoon season has been 3% to 9% below normal.\nThe impact of climate change is becoming increasingly evident. Given the constant and often rapid changes in climate thresholds, there is an urgent need to focus on improving the resilience of Indian cities and urban areas.\nPLANNING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE  \tIt\'s time that urban planning in India acknowledges the reality of climate change. For the most part, Indian urban planning has had little regard for factors such as natural drainage, topography and the near-total absence of non-concretised areas. The practice of reclaiming wetlands for development and choking avenues of natural drainage have reduced the capacity of Indian cities to address climatic variations.\nUrban planning experts said there is a slow but growing awareness of the importance of environmental and climate change factors in planning. "Despite the increased awareness, climate change is still not a key consideration of planning cities in India," said Raina Singh, a fellow at the Centre for Research on Sustainable Urban Development and Transport Systems at the New Delhi-based think tank TERI.\nClimate change concerns need to be mainstreamed into the urban planning and governance processes. Experts point out that climate thresholds are changing rapidly and this information needs to be incorporated into the planning process. At present, the approach is ad hoc - unless something becomes an emergency, there is no action. Singh suggested that the central government needs to identify climate change as a concern and include it in its guidelines and model regulations. Experts agreed, saying that there is a lot of discussion on climate change but no statutory channel to embed these concerns in planning and building laws and regulations.\nOnce the central government acts, Singh said states must amend their laws to make it mandatory to undertake climate vulnerability assessments. This would require adopting a scientific approach to planning. Data is crucial for effective planning. "There needs to be a greater focus on data collection, availability and usage," said Singh.\nIndia\'s metros and tier-1 cities have some data, but the smaller cities lack even the basic statistics required for planning. "Even when data exists, it is disaggregated; so authorities dealing with water, power, transport and solid waste - each has some data that pertains to their sectors. But for data to provide the underpinning of urban planning it has to be available on one platform," Singh explained. The goal of building the climate resilience of our cities requires more than basic data.\nSingh stressed the importance of including climate parameters, which should not be limited to amount of rainfall or temperatures but also include aspects such as waterlogging spots, traffic congestion and disruption of water supply. "The data from all these diverse sources should be able to present a complete risk and vulnerability picture of the city or town," Singh said.\nWHO IS TO BLAME?  \tMuch of the blame for the unpreparedness of Indian cities to deal with extreme rainfall has fallen on municipal corporations for failing to maintain the city\'s drainage system in working condition. Misuse and lack of maintenance of drains contributed to waterlogging and flooding.\nWhile municipal corporations have been derelict, blaming them alone is misplaced. With climate change, threats such as higher temperatures, sea level increases, more intense rain storms and heat waves have become imminent and countering them needs more than just maintaining the city\'s drains.\nCities must reduce the risk and impact of these threats and improve the safety and well-being of people and businesses. That, said urban planners and experts, brings back the core issue of planning. Globally, climate action is driven by cities. Mayors and corporations of leading cities have the power to make decisions and plans that can address the threats of climate change. In India, the devolution of powers to the municipal corporations remains a paper promise. Their writ runs only to civic issues.\nMayors from Indian cities are aware of the dangers of climate change but don\'t have the power to make changes that would minimise or prevent situations like those in Mumbai, Bengaluru or Chandigarh. Urban development is a state subject. Development and planning authorities are under the state government and not the municipal corporations. "Those planning the cities and towns have no accountability to the residents and business, while the urban elected representatives have no power," a senior urban planner explained.\nThere must be integration of the management of climate-sensitive sectors such as waste, water, power and disaster risk reduction. Residents and businesses should participate in the planning process and it should be responsive to needs. Local planning will also induce a level of flexibility, which is crucial given the rapidly changing climate thresholds. Experts argue that if cities have to become climate resilient, it is essential for urban local authorities to drive the planning process.\n'b'ARARAT and Stawell\'s near record-low rain levels last month can be blamed on man-made climate change, according to Friends of the Earth.\nResearch fellow from the CSIRO and University of Melbourne says that climate change might have contributed to dry June conditions in Ararat and Stawell.\nBureau of Meteorology data  released last week showed Ararat experienced its third driest June on record, with Stawell and much of the state seeing \'very much below average\' rainfall.\nCSIRO and University of Melbourne research fellow Dr Penny Whetton said the region\'s conditions fit with predicted weather patterns.\n"Drier winters in Victoria, such as what Ararat and Stawell experienced in June, are inline with the projected impacts of climate change," she said.\nDr Whetton was a lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\'s Third Assessment Report and the Fourth Assessment Report which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\n"The trend is towards drier winters. And we can expect to see more of them without efforts to rein in greenhouse gas emissions," she said.\n"Many farmers will have a tougher time in drier conditions resulting from climate change."\nLast month, Bureau of Meteorology climatologist Blair Trewin said June had been the driest month in the region since the 1970s.\n"We had an unusually high and southward positioned sub-tropical high-pressure belt right over southern Australia, so it was a really dry month right across from southern WA to Victoria," he said.\nFriends of the Earth Act on Climate coordinator Leigh Ewbank said communities in the Ararat and Northern Grampians regions are on the front line of climate change.\n"Climate change is changing the seasons," he said.\n"For some communities this means increased water scarcity and drought, and others it means heightened risk of heatwave and bushfire.\n"What unites all regional communities is the urgent need for governments to invest in climate change solutions."\nMr Ewbank said government support for the  Nectar Farms hydroponic project with a wind farm and battery storage near Stawell, would deliver good outcomes for regional economies.\n"State government support for the Nectar Farms shows that climate solutions bring jobs and investment to regional communities," he said.\nThe federal government is still debating its energy policy, with climate committee chair Craig Kelly claiming renewable energy  would make electricity too expensive and lead to cold-related deaths.\nCREDIT: Rex Martinich\n'b'Serious questions are raised today over hundreds of millions of pounds of British taxpayers money being wasted on climate change projects such as an Ethiopian wind farm and Kenyan solar power plant.\nA Telegraph investigation shows little benefit so far from a 2 billion foreign aid programme to tackle climate change that was established eight years ago.\nOne scheme, costing 260m of UK taxpayers money, has produced only enough renewable electricity to power the equivalent of just 100 British households - about the size of a typical street.\nAn Ethiopian wind far is one of the projects earmarked for funds from the British-backed schemeCredit:      AFP\nProjects including solar parks in Kenya and Mali, a rubbish-burning power plant in the Maldives and wind farmer project in Ethiopia are all earmarked for funding from the scheme.\nThe Telegraph investigation raises major concerns over the use of international aid money to fund complex renewable energy schemes in some of the worlds poorest countries.\nIt will also reignite the row over the Governments commitment, championed by David Cameron, to ring fence the 12 billion annual foreign aid budget, which is fixed at 0.7 per cent of national income.\nCritics have accused the Government of scandalously wasting taxpayers money on the schemes.\nThe current crop of climate change and renewable energy initiatives are showing strong signs of being the most negligently conducted and scandalously wasteful to dateDr John Constable\nWhile officials insist publicly the climate change schemes are working and should only be judged in 2023 at its end point, the department for International Development (Dfid) has expressed concern over delays to projects and the management of them.\nOne senior source said  ministers inside Dfid are questioning whether the money would have been better spent on humanitarian causes instead.\nThe complex set of schemes - known as the Climate Investment Funds (CIFs) - are run by the World Bank, with almost one-third of the 6.75 billion total funding provided by the UK government. No other country has put in so much cash.\nDFID\nThe funds, consisting of four separate schemes, are intended to kick start green energy projects such as the building of large-scale wind and solar farms in poorer countries and environmentally friendly public transport schemes.\nOne of the four schemes - the 630 million Scaling Up Renewable Energy Project (SREP) - was set up with the help of 268 million financing from Dfid and the now defunct Department for Energy and Climate Change.\nBut at the halfway point of the project to provide renewable energy and improve energy access in 28 of the worlds poorest countries, including Haiti, Ethiopia and Bangladesh, little appears to have been achieved by way of effective results.\nTo date, just three SREP-funded projects - two in Honduras and one in Nepal - are producing either green electricity or improving access to it. A further 20 approved projects are not making any positive impact, according to an annual report published at the end of last year.\nSREP has so far produced just 276 MWh of electricity - which experts suggest is equivalent to powering about 100 British households. Its target by 2023 is to produce 2,600 GWh - meaning it is currently producing just 0.01 per cent of the electricity expected in six years time.\nUK Aid table\nSREP is currently providing improved energy access - another of its key targets - to just 7,395 people, equivalent to the market town of Brechin in Scotland. The 2023 target is 4.9 million people, meaning it has so far achieved 0.15 per cent of its intended target.\nThe official figures also show the programme has succeeded to date in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 251.3 tonnes of carbon dioxide - the equivalent to about 95 round trip flights from London to Australia. The programmes target is to cut emissions by 3.6 million tonnes by 2023. It is currently achieving 0.007 per cent of its intended target.\nA second scheme - The Climate Technology Fund - to which the UK has contributed 1.2bn, is intended to deliver green electricity and reduce emissions in middle income countries including gas and oil rich Kazakhstan as well as India, Turkey and Morocco. More than halfway through the scheme, set up in 2009, it is supplying about seven per cent of the renewable energy expected by 2023.\nTo date, only 26 projects out of 70 approved schemes under the CTF have reported any benefit. The vast majority of the projects do not record any figures at all.\nDfids own annual review of the schemes reveals that in 2014 officials were concerned that the CIFs had been slow to put in place practices on carrying out rigorous assessments through evaluation of its projects. Dfid subsequently authorised spending of 6m specifically for evaluation and evidence based learning to address this weakness.\nA year later in 2015, according to the Dfid review, officials wrote to the World Bank highlighting our concerns with aspects of the management of the funds.\nThe Dfid review, published last year, also raises concerns over delays to projects and the inability to demonstrate results.\nIt is understood that Priti Patel, the International Development Secretary, who was appointed last summer, has demanded some of the climate change programmes be more thoroughly investigated.\nA senior Dfid source said: Ministers have called in a number of climate programmes for close scrutiny to ensure they are on track and delivering.\nThe insider added: The money would be better spent  on our humanitarian response with proven results than some of the incredibly complex climate programmes.\nDr John Constable, director of the Renewable Energy Foundation, a charity strongly critical of British green energy policy, said: Overseas development projects have long been plagued with expensive failures, but the current crop of climate change and renewable energy initiatives are showing strong signs of being the most negligently conducted and scandalously wasteful to date.\nNigel Evans, a Conservative MP and member of the international development select committee, said: This is deeply worrying. It raises questions about whether we are spending the money in the right ways.\nWe are supposed to be helping the most vulnerable people in the world and we ought not to be pumping money into projects that are not working.\nAlex Wild, research director at the TaxPayers Alliance said: Its bad enough that people are forced to pay inflated bills for hare-brained green schemes at home, let alone overseas.\nIt looks like these projects are following the Dfid playbook to the letter: throw some money at a project and then when it fails to hit performance targets, throw some more at it. The countries involved would be well advised not to replicate the UKs disastrous energy policies.\nThe Government defended the funds performance.\nA spokesman said: The Climate Investment Fund is helping provide the worlds poorest people with stronger defences to extreme weather which can cause life-threatening crises such as floods, droughts and famine.\nThe UKs investment is already delivering results by producing reliable sources of food, improving infrastructure and giving people access to clean energy, and all programmes are on course to meet the published performance targets for 2023.\nDfid said there had been some major successes and that the funds had reduced green-house gas emissions by the equivalent of taking three million cars off the road. Dfid said that the investment funds were further enabling the building of the equivalent of over a quarter of the current global installed geothermal and concentrated solar power.\nThe World Bank said: The CIFs are a tried, tested, and trusted financing mechanism with over 300 climate smart investments in 72 developing countries around the world. Countries are now reaping the benefits from these investments in the form of cleaner and more reliable energy, new industries and markets, climate resilience and sustainable forestry. None of this would have happened without CIF involvement.\nThe World bank said results were only published when projects were completed and fully up and running. It said that it can take six years for a large-scale solar power plant to move from planning and site acquisition to full service.\nCredit: By Robert Mendick, Chief Reporter\n'b"The accelerated human activity ignited by rapid industrialization and capitalism will have calamitous effects on the global environment and human life. Those who dismiss climate change for the deterioration of environment need to look at a recent study published by Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. While the report notifies every other country to take appropriate steps to protect their populations, the warnings for Pakistan are grave.\nAccording to the study, 'Pakistan will observe almost a double in high-end flood risks.' The country has not completely recovered from the disastrous effects of the last floods of 2010 resulting in the displacement of almost 18 million people, according to Disasters Emergency Committee, a UK based relief organization. The latest study shows that at least 11 million will be at risk if the state fails to take necessary steps for their protection. This is a conservative figure in comparison with the prediction that Pakistan will observe a double in high-end flood risks. The chances are that more than the estimated number will suffer in case of any future floods.\nHas Islamabad taken any steps after the 2010 flooding? Will the latest study prove useful in mobilizing the government of Pakistan to take immediate steps and revisit its outdated disaster management policy in case of any future natural disaster? Fortunately, The National Climate Change Policy of 2012 is Pakistan's guiding document on climate change , setting out the goal of achieving climate-resilient development for the country through mainstreaming climate change in the economically and socially vulnerable sectors of the country. However, all the vigilance on the part of the government is at the moment just that mere vigilance.\nThe government of Pakistan also needs to act upon the recommendations of the latest published study if it wants to protect its population from the catastrophic consequences of future floods. The government needs to take the advice of the institution seriously and start working on required measures on an emergency basis.\n"b'Federal Minister for Climate change Senator Mushahidullah khan called on meeting of Global Change Impact Study Center to brief about their performance.\nDr.Khalid Banuri Chief Executive of Global Change impact Study Centre briefed the Federal Minister about the working of this department.

Sheilas work has been awarded numerous times and in 2007 she was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for demonstrating how global climate change impacts on human rights. \nSheila was born in Kuujjuaq, Nunavik where she was raised traditionally, travelling by dog sled and canoe and eating local game. At 10 years old she was sent to live with a family in Nova Scotia for the purpose of earning an education. As a young woman she attended McGill University in Montreal, where she studied sociology and psychology before returning to Northern Quebec to work in education as a counsellor. \nHer first steps into politics began in the mid-1990s when she became involved with the Makivik Corporation of Nunavik. There, as the groups elected corporate secretary, she helped administer Inuit land claims. This work eventually led to her become involved with the ICC. She was president of the Canadian branch for three terms from 1995 to 2002 and then chair of the international ICC from 2002 to 2005. \nDuring her years with the ICC she helped put Inuit concerns before the global community. On the heels of her time spent with the NGO, she helped launch the worlds first international legal action on climate change claiming that greenhouse gases produced in the United States violated human rights as guaranteed by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Though the petition was never heard, she did testify in 2007 at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights hearing on climate change. \nIn 2015 a memoir about Sheilas life and the effects of climate change on Inuit communities, The Right to Be Cold, was published.

His generalizations about evangelicals would be offensive if they were at least somewhere near the truth.\nEvangelicals prefer the Sharia-like, vindictive cruelty of the Old Testament, and believe that God rewards the good with wealth, and punishes the bad with poverty are so beyond the pale that comment is unnecessary.\nObviously, Brule is angry, but perhaps he has been misled or hasnt really listened to what evangelicals believe. Of course there are a few within every group, even among real Christians, who shamefully misrepresent the whole, but no one should let the tiny minority who arouses their anger define their view of the whole.\nId be glad to buy him coffee if we could be sure to start with ready, then aim and never fire. And maybe hed be more willing to do that knowing I didnt vote for Donald Trump and dont support repeal of the Johnson Amendment.\nMike Jaskilka\nEugene\nLetter on Christians not accurate\nI found the Feb. 20 letter by Jerry Brule interesting. He misinformed his readers about Christians and misquoted the Bible.\nHis use of Deuteronomy 22:23-24 was way off base. It has nothing to do with rape. Jeremiah 1:5 says, Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.\nI cant find anywhere in the Bible where it says life begins with the first breath, or that you should sacrifice the life of a child for the mother.\nIn addition, the continual intolerance throughout the letter is somewhat hypocritical. I believe that an honest search will reveal the wonderful giving and sacrifice by Christians.\nI would never judge whether someone is a Christian or not, as we are told not to judge; thats Gods job. I do think the church should discuss sin inside the church.\nIf you dont claim to be a follower of Christ, there is no sin. I would also never cast the first stone on someone inside the church who is involved in sin.

The single nicest thing I can say is shame on you.\nHoward Robinson\nSpringfield\nMost accept evidence on climate\nMarcia Ferris (Letters, Feb. 18) illustrates how easily people are deceived by thin pseudo-scientific veneers concealing propaganda by industries that employ scientists and corrupt scientific integrity.\nShe cites a 2013 Forbes editorial reporting a survey of scientists and engineers finding that only 36 percent believe global warming is human-caused or of concern. She failed to caution that the population surveyed were members of the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta, membership in which is required for employment by an oil, gas or mining company in Canadas oil-rich province, where the petroleum industry is the principal employer of engineers and geoscientists.\nThe study, in fact, demonstrated how extractive industry livelihoods warp scientific views and work-justification. Those employed by oil and gas companies were much more likely to dispute mainstream climate science. Additionally, the higher in a company hierarchy, the more vehement the opposition.\nNot only were survey respondents industry-dependent, but 84 percent were engineers, including many sub-specialties unrelated to climate science such as electrical engineers and pipeline corrosion specialists.\nComparing these respondents with 1,372 climate researchers, the study found 97 to 98 percent support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change conclusions among the most actively publishing climate researchers. Moreover, the relative climate expertise and scientific prominence of unconvinced researchers are substantially below that of convinced researchers.\nAnother peer-reviewed survey of 10,257 climate-change scientists found 97 percent recognition of anthropogenic global warming among actively publishing climate scientists, and almost 90 percent among all actively publishing earth scientists.\nJack Dresser\nSpringfield\nWriters facts deserve scrutiny\nI give more credence to those letters from readers who cite their source for the information that has formed their opinions. I also check the accuracy of those citations. Marcia Ferris Feb. 18 letter criticizing The Register-Guard cited Forbes as her basis for believing that global warming is supported by only 36 percent of scientists and engineers. I went to Forbes, read the Feb. 3, 2013, article, an opinion piece that referred to the American Meteorological Society as the authors source. I went to the AMS website and found this:\nResearch conducted to date with meteorologists and other atmospheric scientists has shown that they are not unanimous in their views of climate change. In a survey of Earth scientists, Doran and Zimmerman (2009) found that while a majority of meteorologists surveyed are convinced humans have contributed to global warming (GW; 64 percent), this was a substantially smaller majority than that found among all Earth scientists (82 percent). Another survey, by Farnsworth and Lichter (2009), found that 83 percent of meteorologists surveyed were convinced human induced climate change is occurring, again a smaller majority than among experts in related areas, such as ocean sciences (91 percent) and geophysics (88 percent) (American Meteorological Society, July 2014).\nI also researched Paul Krugmans op-ed piece to which Ferris refers in the Feb. 14 Register-Guard, related to Krugmans defamation of Betsy DeVos as ignorant. Krugman says that DeVos was ignorant about the most elementary issues ... related to the scope of the Education Department after watching her at her confirmation hearing (The New York Times, Feb. 14).\nRon Teninty\nEugene\nPeaceHealth put money over people\nShame on PeaceHealth for notifying 330 employees of pending layoffs.

A century ago "it wouldn\'t have been that strange. Things like this are becoming stranger."\nThe study by the World Weather Attribution analyzed weather records dating to 1880 and found the cold weather that hit a swath of the U.S. from Maine to Minnesota tends to happen once every 250 years. In the early 1900s, it happened about once every 17 years. Climate change has made such cold spells less common and less intense, the group said.\nThat finding agrees with earlier studies, said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd, who wasn\'t part of the study.\n"I think the public frenzy over the recent cold snap illustrated that we are less acclimated to such events," he said in an email.\nThe study, based on observations and statistics, did not find evidence that would link the cold snap to a popular scientific theory that links melting Arctic sea ice to blasts of cold air escaping the top of the world.\nThe theory, which is still debated by scientists but gaining credence among many, is based on pressure changes and other factors that cause the jet stream to plunge and weather systems to get stuck. But the latest analysis didn\'t find such evidence.\nThree scientists whose studies have connected Arctic warming to changes in extreme events disagree.\nBecause such atmospheric pressure changes happen occasionally, quick studies that rely on averages often miss extreme events like the recent cold spell, said James Overland, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who supports the theory.\nCredit: SETH BORENSTEIN; Associated Press\nCaption: FILE - In this Jan. 7, 2018, file photo, fishing trawlers sit on the frozen harbor of Lake Montauk surrounded by thin sheets of ice in Montauk, N.Y.

When it comes to global warming, national security has taken a back seat to ideology and campaign contributions. There is little doubt, outside of Washington, D.C., about the causes of climate change. That the planet is getting warmer due to human activity is confirmed by 97 percent of climate scientists and nearly 200 scientific academies. As the American Association for the Advancement of Science noted, science is as certain of the reality of human-caused climate disruption as it is of the link between smoking and cancer. \nBut an alternate reality has been promulgated by fossil fuel interests and free-market fundamentalists. These "merchants of doubt" create distrust in climate science. The tobacco industry ran a similar campaign successfully for decades. \nNow we have an EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, who wants a public "debate" on the issue. This is like the head of the American Medical Association calling for a debate on whether smoking causes cancer. Such efforts are working. In a recent poll, less than a quarter of Americans reported being "very worried" about warming. \nBut the U.S. military is very worried, and has been for years. \nIn 2007, when George W. Bush was president, a military board produced the report National Security and the Threat of Climate Change. It affirmed that "climate change can act as a threat multiplier for instability ... and it presents significant national security challenges for the United States." \nThe 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review Report by the Department of Defense termed global warming "an accelerant of instability or conflict." Dozens of other reports have expounded on this threat. \nDavid Titley, a retired rear admiral who has a Ph.D. in meteorology, spoke for many in the military when he wrote in 2014: "The climate is changing. We can do something about it. For the sake of our nation and the world, we must act." \nThe last five defense secretaries, starting with Bush\'s Robert Gates, have urged action. In testimony to Congress , Donald Trump\'s Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis called climate change "a challenge that requires a broader, whole-of-government response." \nMilitary strategists, unlike politicians, can\'t afford to play ideological games when it comes to national security. They must focus on how climate disruption is creating political destabilization globally and straining the military\'s ability to respond to crises. \nBut Republicans in Congress are not being helpful. They tried to prevent the Defense Department from studying the security impacts of climate disruption. Fortunately, enough in the GOP cared about national security to join Democrats in voting against the effort. \nBut Trump remains incalcitrant, dismissing a threat the military considers to be severe. \nSo here are two more questions: What politicians do you want in office making decisions about national security? And where does your representative in Congress stand\'\nCredit: DAVID BARNHILL; Barnhill is emeritus director of environmental studies at UW-Oshkosh:barnhill@uwosh.edu. He wrote this for the Progressive Media Project in Madison.\n'b'Re: March to support movement on climate action.\nThe day before thousands of Americans marched on Washington and hundreds of Missoulians marched down Higgins Avenue in support of climate action, the Trump administration quietly deleted a decades-old climate change information hub from the Environmental Protection Agencys website.\nThis kind of censorship isnt just a denial of sound science. It also denies the wishes of the overwhelming majority of Americans. Recent polling found that 61 percent of voters nationwide disapprove of Donald Trumps handling of the environment - more than twice the number of voters who approve. And 60 percent of Americans opposed President Trumps extreme attempts to slash EPAs funding.\nMontana opposes President Trumps efforts to block climate action and stifle the will of the people - U.S. Sen. Jon Tester should too.\n\nSkye Borden,\n\n\nMissoula\n\n'b'Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas, ranking Democratic member of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, issued the following statement at a hearing on "Climate Science: Assumptions, Policy Implications, and the Scientific Method":\n"Thank you Chairman Smith for calling today\'s hearing on Climate Science.  I also want to thank our witnesses for being here today.\n"I want to start off today by placing our current situation in some historical perspective.  The existence of the "greenhouse effect" was first proposed in the early 1800\'s.  By the late 1800\'s scientists began to theorize that increases in carbon dioxide in our atmosphere could lead to global warming.  By 1960 scientists had shown that carbon dioxide was in fact increasing in the atmosphere and humans were at least in part responsible for the increase.  Scientific evidence for human induced climate change rapidly increased throughout the 1970\'s.\n"By 1982, even oil giant Exxon\'s own scientists were reporting to management that climate change due to carbon dioxide emissions was likely to occur, and that the effects of this climate change could be catastrophic.  Since the early 1980\'s when Exxon internally acknowledged the reality of climate change, the scientific evidence confirming human caused climate change has piled up at an incredible rate.  The current scientific consensus on human caused climate change is based on thousands of scientific studies conducted by thousands of scientists all across the globe.\n"What does that word - consensus- actually mean?  It means the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, which is composed of scientists from around the world, has concluded that "warming of the climate system is unequivocal," and that "it is extremely likely that human influence was the dominant cause of global warming."  The IPCC is not alone.  The National Academies of Sciences has reached the same conclusion.  In fact, the national academies of sciences in virtually every major country on Earth has endorsed the IPCC\'s central conclusions on climate change.  Most relevant scientific societies, including AAAS, the American Physical Society, the American Geophysical Union, the American Meteorological Society, and a host of others have also affirmed the overwhelming scientific evidence for human caused climate change.\n"Unfortunately, the long established scientific understanding of the reality of climate change ends at the doorstep of the Republican National Committee.  Republicans in Congress overwhelmingly reject or minimize the scientific consensus on climate change.  In this, they follow the leader of the Republican Party, President Trump, who once claimed that climate change was a hoax perpetrated by China.  Even on this Committee on Science, Republican Members have postulated sometimes unique theories about climate change, some of which have become punchlines on late night television.\n"It saddens me that Majority Members of Congress and of this Committee in particular, consistently ignore the thousands of scientists around the world who maintain mainstream climate science views, instead repeatedly calling a handful of preferred witnesses over and over again to testify.  For instance, the three witnesses called by the Majority today have collectively appeared in front of Congress at least 20 times over the past decade.\n"Disturbingly, the Majority\'s unwillingness to accept the strong scientific consensus on climate change has led them to harass scientists who disagree with them.  For example, the Majority on this Committee has issued subpoenas for the emails of climate scientists at NOAA- taking a page out of the playbook of fossil industry funded front groups who have harassed climate scientists across the country.  In the process our Majority has brought condemnation upon this once great committee from across the scientific community.\n"Perhaps in retaliation for their inconvenient truths, climate scientists are now being targeted with massive budget cuts by Republicans in the White House and Congress.  These cuts would devastate our ability to understand and mitigate the future effects of climate change.  I sincerely hope that someday soon the Committee on Science will cease lecturing and harassing scientists, and instead return to listening to and supporting them.  America will be far better off if we do.\n"Finally, I am attaching a report prepared by Democratic Staff to my opening statement. This report details the Majority\'s nearly two-year long investigation into a climate science paper that was prepared by NOAA-scientists and published in the journal Science in June 2015.\n"I yield back."\n07K-Vail-5820894 07K-Vail\n'b'WASHINGTON * President Donald Trump\'s "America First" vision is a stark worldview that sees rivals battling each other for supremacy or relevance and has little use for alliances, treaties and other international agreements unless they directly benefit the United States, its industry and workers.\nTrump\'s doctrine, to be laid out next week when he unveils his National Security Strategy, holds that nation-states are in perpetual competition and the U.S. must fight on all fronts to protect and defend its sovereignty from friend and foe alike. While the administration often says that "America First" does not mean "America Alone," the strategy to be presented by Trump on Monday will make clear that the United States will stand up for itself even if that means acting unilaterally or alienating others on issues such as trade, climate change and immigration, according to sources familiar with the strategy.\nIf fully implemented, the strategy could represent a profound shift from the traditional post-Cold War approach to global affairs taken by administrations of both political parties over the past three decades. With few exceptions, those administrations have embraced or sought to embrace multilateral cooperation and engagement.\nDespite the risk of potential isolation presented by Trump\'s strategy, its fundamentals are not a surprise. The Associated Press reviewed excerpts of a late draft of the roughly 70-page document and spoke to two sources familiar with it. The strategy is largely drawn from themes Trump has described in speeches and is based on four pillars: protecting the homeland, stimulating American prosperity, promoting peace through strength and enhancing American leadership.\nIt is rooted in Trump\'s belief that competition rather than cooperation defines the current global environment, the sources said. An excerpt of the strategy seen by the AP emphasizes that America has often fought to protect its interests.\n"America\'s achievements and standing in the world were neither inevitable nor accidental," the draft says. "On many occasions Americans have had to compete with adversarial forces to preserve and advance our security, prosperity, and the principles we hold dear."\nNational security adviser H.R. McMaster outlined the four pillars of the strategy in a speech this week in which he declared that "geopolitics are back and they are back with a vengeance."\nHe said the new strategy, the first of Trump\'s administration, would identify threats to the United States and its interests from "revisionist powers" such as Russia and China, "rogue regimes" such as Iran and North Korea, and nonstate actors such as terrorist groups and criminal enterprises. In that, the strategy is not dissimilar to those of previous administrations.\nBut the sources, who fleshed out McMaster\'s preview on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly pre-empt Trump\'s speech, said it would emphasize that U.S. economic security is national security and that economic security must be ensured with military might. And they said it would stress the U.S. is only interested in relationships with other countries, including alliances such as NATO, that are fair and reciprocal.\nStrong borders\nIn addition, the strategy will say that staying competitive and successfully defending U.S. sovereignty starts with protecting America\'s borders and controlling who may cross them.\n"Strengthening control over our borders and immigration system is central to national security, economic prosperity, and the rule of law," the draft says. "Terrorists, drug traffickers, and criminal cartels exploit porous borders and threaten U.S. security and public safety. These actors adapt quickly to outpace our defenses. The United States affirms its sovereign right to determine who should enter our country and under what circumstances."\nThe early draft of the strategy lamented that America had put itself at a disadvantage by entering into multinational agreements, such as those aimed at combatting climate change, and introducing domestic policies to implement them. That draft played down the national security risk of climate change and emphasized the costs to the U.S. economy of environmental and other regulations aimed at mitigating it.\nIt was not immediately clear if the climate change language would be in the final version of the strategy.\nThe sources said the document would identify predators and pledge that the U.S. would treat them as such.\nChina, for example, is to be chided for allegedly manipulating the rules-based international economic order for its own advantage and Russia for campaigns to disrupt democratic processes in former Soviet states, Europe and the U.S.\nCredit: MATTHEW LEE; Associated Press\n'b'CHEYENNE, Wyo. * Handing a major victory to environmentalists, a court cast doubt Friday on a longstanding U.S. government argument that blocking federal coal leasing won\'t affect climate change because the coal could simply be mined elsewhere.\nEnvironmentalists have been trying for years to block federal coal leases on climate-change grounds with limited success. The ruling by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will require the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to provide more data to support its argument that coal makes no net contribution to climate change after it\'s burned in power plants. The BLM oversees leasing of vast Western tracts that supply much of the nation\'s coal.\n"This is big. And we\'re certainly going to be wielding this and using it to confront other mining approvals both in the Powder River Basin and beyond," said Jeremy Nichols with WildEarth Guardians.\nThe Sierra Club and WildEarth Guardians sued to block four leases that would allow mining to continue at the Black Thunder and North Antelope Rochelle mine, the two biggest in the U.S. by production. Both are in the Powder River Basin, where vast, open-pit mines supply about 40 percent of the nation\'s coal.\nIn analyzing the leases, the BLM found that burning the coal deposits would result in 382 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, or about 6 percent of the U.S. total in 2008.\nBut the BLM argued that because utilities could simply get their coal from mines that don\'t lease federal deposits, blocking the leases would have no net effect on climate change.\nThe appeals court wasn\'t persuaded, ruling that the BLM didn\'t provide sufficient data to back up that argument. It told a lower court to seek more analysis from the agency.\nIn the meantime, mining will continue at three of the contested leases the BLM sold to Peabody Energy and Arch Coal, the St. Louis-based companies that own the two mines. A fourth contested lease near Black Thunder hasn\'t sold yet.\nBLM officials didn\'t immediately return a message seeking comment. Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead, a staunch supporter of the coal industry, said he was disappointed in the ruling but pleased that mining could continue.\nCredit: Associated Press\nCaption: In this April 30, 2007, file photo, a shovel prepares to dump a load of coal into a 320-ton truck at the Arch Coal Inc.-owned Black Thunder mine in Wright, Wyo.

Interstate highways were turned into raging rivers. The second floors of many homes and apartment buildings were reached by flood waters.\nBut the epochal flooding of Houston and several other areas of Texas do not represent a one-off event.\nAs Texas counted the dead and tallied up the billions of dollars in damage caused by Harvey, South Asia saw 1,200 deaths and millions of people made homeless by unusually powerful monsoon rains that left cities in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan under water.\nIn July, unprecedented rains flooded subway stations and turned streets into lakes in Istanbul, one of Europe\'s most populous cities.\nThere\'s no doubt about it: With drastic climate change, the world is experiencing historic storms more often.\nHurricane Katrina did to New Orleans and southern Louisiana in 2005 what Harvey did to Houston and surrounding environs this year - an entire metropolitan area was affected, and the impact will be long-lasting.\nHurricane Rita, which followed Katrina in 2005, served as a stark wake-up call for Houston, which was well-prepared for the wind event but could have never foreseen the floods wrought by Harvey.\nSuperstorm Sandy in 2012 put New York City on notice that it was not immune to the effects of climate change. Flooded subways and major Internet switching centers in Manhattan were a reality and not fodder for disaster movies.\nThe Carolinas were continuing to rebuild from 2016\'s Hurricane Matthew unprecedented flooding when Harvey struck Texas.\nDemands for assistance from such federal entities as the National Flood Insurance Program reached new levels and put new stresses on the already in-debt flood relief fund.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has counted an average of 15 named Atlantic storms each year from 1995 to 2012, an increase from years past. The frequency of the storms was directly attributed to warming oceans resulting from our warming atmosphere.\nThe simultaneous collapsing of ice formations in Antarctica and the Arctic will have irreversible effects on coastal flooding, sea currents and the abundance of marine life.\nThe collapse of marine ecosystems is already having disastrous results for species up and down the marine food chain. Eventually, the top of that food chain, humankind, will suffer from oceans devoid of sustaining food resources.\nWith Miami streets now flooding during non-storm-related tides, a Harvey-like storm striking Miami would leave permanent changes to the shorelines.\nPresident Donald Trump calls climate change a Chinese-manufactured "hoax."\nPerhaps when the president\'s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., is inundated by the rising waters of the Atlantic Ocean, he might come to his senses about the realities behind global climate change and understand that his reliance on fake science has put more than his golfing and banquet buddies at risk.\n'b"The president's rejection of an international climate agreement last week was disappointing but expected. He already had signed executive orders in March to dismantle the previous administration's limits on carbon emissions from power plants, which was central to America's compliance with the Paris Accord.\nYet as much as President Donald Trump, with all his bluster, wants to steer America backward - pretending our nation's future can run on the dirty coal of the past - reality will prevail. \nTrump won't have the last word on protecting our environment and economy for future generations. Instead, private businesses, entrepreneurs and energy users will continue to innovate and adapt. And to prosper in the global economy, our nation will have little choice but to pursue increasingly affordable clean energy solutions. \nHere's reality: Lots of power companies, including Madison Gas and Electric locally, are still planning to meet the goals for lower carbon emissions to ease climate change, as set by former President Barack Obama. And some utilities are going much further, doing today what Trump seems to think is impossible. \nIowa's largest utility, MidAmerican Energy, is investing billions of dollars in wind energy with the goal of increasing its renewable power production from 55 percent today to 90 percent within a few years. And it's promising not to raise its rates for more than a decade. \nAt the same time, Iowa - a state Trump won in 2016 but will have a hard time winning in 2020 by touting coal - counts more than 6,000 jobs in the wind industry. \nNationwide, wind power employs more than 100,000, while solar energy accounts for 374,000 jobs, compared to coal's 160,000. Jobs in bioenergy now top 130,000. \nFurther expansion of renewable energy will help ease our warming climate, which poses serious risk to our economy and way of life. The conservative approach should be to plan ahead and to hedge against risk. Instead, President Trump is recklessly ignoring scientific evidence of a serious and growing threat. \nHis own secretary of state, Rex Tillerson - the former CEO of an oil company that supports the Paris agreement - had recommended Trump stick with the international accord. Doing so would allow America to lead on the issue, rather than cede global influence to China, as the president is doing. \nIn Trump's dark vision, America will suffer blackouts, businesses will halt and millions of jobs will be lost unless our nation clings to the dirty coal that powered the Industrial Revolution more than a century ago. Trump oddly views international cooperation on a non-binding goal of reducing the carbon emissions linked to climate change as a devious plot, rather than part of the solution it is. \nBecause the Paris agreement is largely symbolic, Trump's rejection won't halt our nation's or the world's progress. As Tillerson said Friday, America will continue to reduce its emissions. It also must invest in research and technology. \nTrump predictably got it wrong last week. But America will still get it right.\n"b'Until Thursday afternoon, none of the bad decisions President Donald Trump has made since his inauguration actually posed an existential threat to the planet. But by announcing he would pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement on climate change, Trump crossed that dire threshold.\nIt was shocking that the president chose the sunny White House Rose Garden to celebrate news that will make him a pariah in history. Now begins a four-year process of withdrawing U.S. participation from an agreement among 195 nations to try to cut greenhouse gas emissions.\nTrump said America has to think of itself first. Cutting greenhouses gases means burning less fossil fuel, particularly coal. That has hurt the already ailing coal industry, but make no mistake, Thursday\'s announcement won\'t bring coal jobs back. Cheaper energy sources make coal uneconomical. Trump is lying to vulnerable people.\nA coalition of 300 business leaders, including oil executives, had urged Trump to stay the course on climate. There are twice as many jobs in the booming solar energy sector as there are in coal. American companies need foreign markets and predictability. Trump chose the mirage of short-term political gain over business interests and the planet\'s future.\nThe goal of the December 2015 Paris Agreement was to put the world on course to avoid raising the planet\'s average temperature by more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over the pre-industrial average. That may not sound like much, but scientific consensus says the planet can\'t stand more than such a rise by century\'s end if it wants to avoid rising sea levels that will wipe out coastal areas, bring on drought and starvation that will displace 100 million people and lead to more frequent and vicious storms.\nThe Paris Agreement, officially the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, was officially adopted in December 2015. Unofficially, it had been in progress since 1992. In 2001, President George W. Bush dropped U.S. participation, but President Barack Obama resumed it. Obama agreed with the argument that the United States, which has contributed a third of the planet-heating atmospheric carbon dioxide, had a special leadership responsibility.\nTrump has repudiated that leadership. China and India, with much higher economic stakes in using coal, are on course to meeting their goals. But Trump refuses to commit to reducing U.S. emissions by up to 28 percent over 2005 levels. He says, however, that he is willing to renegotiate.\nTrump has ceded climate leadership, to say nothing of global moral leadership. On top of Trump\'s questioning of major trade agreements, and coming so shortly after his refusal to wholeheartedly commit to NATO defense agreements, the climate decision makes the United States an outlier.\nThis is not "America first." This is America alone.\nCredit: By the Editorial Board\nCaption: Editorial Cartoon by Pat Bagley, The Salt Lake Tribune - Deadly Emissions Smokestacks spewing a black cloud of GREENHOUSE GASES Donald Trump spewing a black cloud of IGNORANCE President Donald Trump speaks about the U.S. role in the Paris climate change accord on Thursday.

As we all know, the dragon is carbon dioxide (CO2).\nThe premier refers to CO2 as pollution. Ivar Giaver, a Norwegian Nobel Prize-winning physicist says: "One thing you should not do is confuse pollution with CO2-CO2 is not pollution."\nWilliam Happer, an atomic physicist at Princeton and member of JASON (a group of elite scientists who advise the U.S. government on matters of science and technology), says: "We need to be vigilant to keep our land, air, and waters free of real pollution...but CO2 is not one of these pollutants."\nFreeman Dyson, the brilliant Princeton scientist who, like Happer, is a member of the elite scientific group JASON, acknowledges the mechanism by which many believe human action can influence climate, yet says the computer models can\'t possibly capture what\'s going on.\nDyson speaks to the beneficial impact of CO2. In an interview with journalist Paul Mulshine, Dyson said: "It\'s certainly true that CO2 is good for vegetation. About 15% of agricultural yields are due to CO2 we put in the atmosphere. From that point of view, it\'s a real plus to burn coal and oil."\nPatrick Moore (Ph.D. ecology) is the cofounder of Greenpeace who served nine years as president of Greenpeace Canada and seven as a director of Greenpeace International. He says that CO2 is not a pollutant, but a colourless, odorless, tasteless gas and the most important food for life on earth. If the earth\'s CO2 levels aren\'t above 150 parts per million (ppm) he says that plants would die.\nMoore states that throughout the earth\'s history, CO2 levels have been drawn down (by plants) from around 3,000 ppm to roughly 280 ppm-the level reached prior to the Industrial Revolution. If the decline had continued, CO2 would have become too low to support life. Fortunately, the Industrial Revolution sparked the use of fossil fuels, which boosted CO2 from the lowest levels in earth\'s history to just over 400 ppm today.\nMoore says: "At 400 parts per million, all our food crops, forests, and natural ecosys-tems are still on a starvation diet for carbon dioxide. The optimum level of CO2 for plant growth... is about 1,500 parts per million, nearly four times higher than today, [which is why] greenhouse growers inject CO2" into their nurseries.\nEcologist Moore also says the earth has been warming since long before the heavy use of fossil fuels. He further says the idea that it would be catastrophic if CO2 were to increase, and average global temperature were to rise. is preposterous. "There has been no significant warming for 18 years while we have emitted 25% of all the CO2 ever emitted," he said.\nTom Harris of the Ottawabased International Climate Science Coalition says climate science is definitely not settled, and further indicates that the reason politicians like Rachel Notley throw around the term "carbon pollution," is that it conjures up false images of dark and dangerous soot emissions even though CO2 has absolutely nothing to do with either soot or pollution. He says that demonizing CO2 is how climate alarmists discourage critical thinking, alarm the public, and justify their political agendas.\n"At the Grassroots" is a feature service of Grassroots Alberta.\nThe author, Kevin Avram, is a director of Grassroots Alberta.

On the other hand, she said that just last week it was too hot and buggy to go out  in late October, near Chicago.\nThe trend of ever-later first freezes appears to have started about 1980, according to an analysis by The Associated Press of data from 700 weather stations across the U.S. going back to 1895 compiled by Ken Kunkel, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\'s National Centers for Environmental Information.\nTo look for nationwide trends, Kunkel compared the first freeze from each of the 700 stations to the station\'s average for the 20th century. Some parts of the country experience earlier or later freezes every year, but on average, freezes are coming later.\nThis year, about 40 percent of the Lower 48 states have had a freeze as of Oct. 23, compared with 65 percent in a normal year, according to Jeff Masters, meteorology director of the private service Weather Underground.\nThis shrinking freeze season is what climate scientists have long predicted, University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado said.\nA shorter freeze season means a longer growing season and less money spent on heat. But it also hurts some plants that require a certain amount of chill, such as Georgia peaches, said Theresa Crimmins, a University of Arizona ecologist.\nKevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said natural variability, especially an El Nio, made last year exceptional for an early freeze, but "it represents the kind of conditions that will be more routine in a decade or two" because of man-made climate change.\n"The long-term consequences are really negative," said Primack, because shorter winters and hotter temperatures are also expected to lead to rising seas that cause worse flooding during heavy storms.\nCredit: SETH BORENSTEIN; Associated Press\nCaption: FILE - This Monday, Oct. 23, 2017 file photo show fall colors beginning to show along Route 209 in Reilly Township, Schuylkill County, Pa.

I earned every bit of it. I also struggled mightily in physics and was clueless in chemistry. My chemistry teacher, Mr. Spencer, was a wonderful man, but he might as well have been explaining the periodic table in Pashto.\nI say this because you would be hard-pressed to find someone more unqualified than me to weigh in on the scientific merits of climate change theory.\nBut I can read. (Stop me if this sounds like bragging.) I can also see and hear.\nAs someone who has stood outside during several hurricanes, microphone in hand, explaining to viewers how dangerous it would be to go outside - as I silently worried about being impaled on a stop sign or floating away like Mary Poppins - I know how easy it is to get caught up in hurricane fever, or snowstorm mania, or heat wave hysteria. Pick your own weather catastrophe.\nBut there is something unbecoming about using a storm that is in the process of affecting the lives of millions of people as an I-told-you-so moment.\nAnd yet, many seized the opportunity.\nFor example, we might as well start at the top, the very top - with the pope.\nYou can see the effects of climate change, and scientists have clearly said what path we have to follow, Pope Francis said, as Hurricane Irma was bearing down on Florida.\nOn Sunday, as Irma was making landfall, New York Magazine asked, Will Irma Finally Change the Way We Talk About Climate?\nThe mayor of Miami, as residents of his city were evacuating: If this isnt climate change, I dont know what is, Mayor Tomas Regalado, a Republican, told reporters after declaring a state of emergency in his city.\nThere was a more balanced perspective. As The New York Times reported, Sept. 6, As to whether climate change has somehow made this year worse, the links between climate change and hurricane activity are complex and there are still many uncertainties.\nDr. Gerry Bell, lead seasonal hurricane forecaster with the Climate Prediction Center, told the Times that, Weve been in an active era since 1995.\nYoull get no analysis from me here.\nI do know that major weather events tend to bring out the best in people. They also inspire new levels of hyperbole, in both diagnosis and description.\nSome of the assessments of Irma were almost biblical. My favorite came from a Weather Channel reporter, live in Naples, Florida: The day of reckoning is upon us, he grimly prophesied.\nThere were a few honorable mention moments.\nMiami Beach Mayor Philip Levine: This is a nuclear nightmare.\nCNN reporter Bill Weir: Its like power-washing my face! (It was television so I assumed the exclamation point.)\nAnd heres a headline on a blog post, written prior to Irmas landfall by Michael Snyder, a Republican candidate for Congress in Idaho:\nCategory 6? If Hurricane Irma Becomes The Strongest Hurricane In History, It Could Wipe Entire Cities Off The Map\nAs a footnote, Snyder believes the world will be ending soon - like any minute.\nAll of this reminds me of an episode of The Simpsons, in which the blowhard TV news anchor Kent Brockman reports on an uprising by children at a summer camp: Ladies and gentlemen, Ive been to Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq, and I can say without hyperbole that this is a million times worse than all of them put together.\nYes, a hurricane is serious business. Ive seen them up close. Its a terrifying experience. Harvey and Irma affected millions of people. Lives were lost, as were homes and possessions. Isnt it then a bit gauche to begin the cause-and-effect discussions before the rain has even stopped?\nTheres a time to have the discussion, and just because I might doze off while were having it - hence my biology grade - doesnt mean its not worthwhile. But perhaps we can wait until the patio furniture stops flying through the air before we restart the debate over CO2 levels.\nAfter all, no thinking person goes to a hospital waiting room during his friends open heart surgery and says to the family, I told Larry he shouldnt eat so much dairy.\nAt that moment, no one wants to hear such a thing. Thats reason enough not to say it.\n\n\nRich Manieri is the deputy Opinion editor at LNP. Email: rmanieri@lnpnews.com. Twitter: @RichManieriLNP.

The slowdown or hiatus was mentioned, however, in the IPCC fifth assessment report, and  behind the vitriol there has been a lot of work done to provide some answers for the sixth assessment report to be published next year.\nThe latest instalment is a paper by a group of the world\'s leading climate scientists who now admit climate models have been wrong and must be adjusted to better reflect the results of satellite temperature measurements. During the past two decades, these results have shown a slowdown in temperature rises in the troposphere, which is the lowest layer of the  atmosphere where almost all of our weather occurs.\nThe admission is contained in a new paper published in Nature Geoscience, which says a combination of factors including natural variability and unforeseen events have been responsible for models over-estimating the temperature rise. Natural variability includes the El Nino and La Nina weather patterns and oscillations on a decadal scale in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Unforeseen factors that contributed to cooling included volcanic eruptions, a weaker sun in the last solar cycle and increased particulate pollution from Chinese coal-fired power plants.\nThe paper, Causes of Differ ences in Model and Satellite Tropospheric Warming Rates, is lead-authored by Benjamin Santer from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the US, and includes Michael Mann from the Earth System Science Centre at Pennsylvania State University and Matthew England from the University of NSW.\nSceptics have claimed the paper as evidence to support the pause. But the authors say their paper rules out claims the atmosphere is less sensitive to carbon dioxide or that future warming was not a concern.\n"None of our findings call into question the reality of long-term warming of Earth\'s troposphere and surface, or cast doubt on prevailing estimates of the amount of warming we can expect from future increases in (greenhouse gas) concentrations," the authors say.\n"Even though the most recent 20-year warming trend is smaller than in earlier parts of the satellite record, it is still significantly larger than the range of 20-year trends caused by internal climate variability alone." The paper says that in the early 21st century, satellite-derived tropospheric warming trends have been generally smaller than trends estimated from a collection of models run many times.\nAfter analysing satellite temperatures and model simulations the scientists found internal variability could explain differences between modelled and observed tropospheric temperature trends in the last two decades of the 20th century.\nHowever, it cannot explain the divergence for the past two decades of this century, the time of the pause. The latest paper follows on from another with many of the same authors, including  Santer and England, published in Nature in February last year.\nThat paper, Making Sense of the Early 2000s Warming Slowdown, was one of the first signs of a building consensus position between key climate scientists and sceptics on the existence of a slowdown. The paper rejected the finding of other scientists that "claims of a hiatus in global warming lack sound scientific basis". Those scientists sceptical of the hiatus had "benchmarked the recent slowdown against a baseline period that includes times with a lower rate of increase in greenhouse forcing", it said.\nIn keeping with the latest research findings, last year\'s paper said the reduction arose though the combined effects of internal decadal variability, volcanic and solar activity, and decadal changes in anthropogenic aerosol forcing. These findings contrast with the harsh criticism levelled at sceptics who first highlighted the existence of the slowdown or pause.\nIt is why many sceptics advocate a more robust contest of climate science alongside the peer-reviewed process.\nThe immediate dispute is over whether the spike in global temperatures during the most recent El Nino represented an end to the pause. The latest evidence is that temperatures are returning quickly to pre-El Nino levels.\nNoted contrarian Judith Curry argues there are better ways to assess science for policymakers than a consensus-seeking process that she says serves to stifle disagreement and debate. "The climate community has prematurely elevated a scientific hypothesis on human-caused climate change to a ruling theory through claims of a consensus," Curry says.\n"Premature theories enforced by an explicit consensus-building process harm scientific progress because of the questions that don\'t get asked and the investigations that aren\'t undertaken." Curry argues "our understanding of climate dynamics on decadal to century to millennial timescales is far from complete", something supported by the latest research. But Mann -- who characterised Curry as a "denier" in a recent US house committee hearing -- says "we understand the science of climate just about as well as we understand the science of just about anything".\nThe election of Donald Trump and pending withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement has emboldened many who want to promote a more rigorous debate. Scott Pruitt, the new head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, has put his weight behind calls for a red team v blue team examination of the climate science.\nUnder such as proposal, two teams would review a published scientific report such as the UN Summary for Policymakers or the US government\'s National Climate Assessment. A red team would critique the document and a blue team would challenge the  critique. A commission would moderate the process and conduct public hearings to highlight points of agreement and dispute.\nPruitt says the American people deserve "a true, legitimate, peer-reviewed, objective, transparent discussion about CO2 ... what we know, what we don\'t know and what risk does it pose to health, the US and the world. It\'s something we hope to provide as part of our leadership." In The Wall Street Journal last month Steve Koonin, a theoretical physicist and former undersecretary during Barack Obama\'s first term, said the outcome of a red-blue exercise was not preordained.\n"It could reveal the current consensus as weaker than claimed," he said. "Alternatively, the consensus could emerge strengthened if red team criticisms were countered effectively."The suggestion is that any red team-blue team exercise be co-ordinated by the National Security Agency rather than the major science academies. Critics argue it is just another attempt to muddy the waters with uncertainty. They say healthy scepticism and competi tion already exist in the peer review process.\nCredit: Graham Lloyd\n'b'VATICAN CITY * German Chancellor Angela Merkel says Pope Francis encouraged her to work to preserve the historic Paris climate accord despite the U.S. withdrawal from it and shared her goal to "bring down walls" between countries, not build them.\nMerkel and Francis met for about 40 minutes Saturday in the Apostolic Palace, focusing on the Group of 20 summit that Germany is hosting in Hamburg on July 7-8.\nThe Vatican said the talks centered on the need for the international community to combat poverty, hunger, terrorism and climate change.\nMerkel told reporters she briefed the pope on Germany\'s G-20 agenda, which she said "assumes that we are a world in which we want to work together multilaterally, a world in which we don\'t want to build walls but bring down walls."\nFrancis has consistently called on nations to build bridges, not walls  including reference to the wall that President Donald Trump\'s administration has proposed for along the U.S. border with Mexico.\nMerkel said Francis encouraged her to fight for international agreements, including the 2015 Paris climate accord, which aims to curb emissions.\n"We know that, regrettably, the United States is leaving this accord," Merkel said.\nAs he did when Trump visited last month, Francis gave Merkel a copy of his environmental encyclical, "Praise Be," which casts fighting climate change and caring for the environment as an urgent moral obligation.\nFrancis issued the encyclical ahead of the Paris climate deal in hopes of urging a global consensus on the need to change "perverse" development models that he said had turned God\'s creation into an "immense pile of filth."\nThe audience began with Francis\' expressing his condolences over the death of former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who died Friday.\nCredit: NICOLE WINFIELD; Associated Press\nCaption: Pope Francis and German Chancellor Angela Merkel shake hands on the occasion of their private audience, at the Vatican, Saturday, June 17, 2017.

Nearly every country in the world, including the U.S., signed the accord in 2015 to voluntarily reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Nearly 150 nations have since ratified it.\nTrump was critical of the deal during his campaign .\nClimate change is undeniable and it is "absolutely essential" the world fight the problem together, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres argued on Tuesday.\n"If any government doubts the global will and need for this accord, that is reason for all others to unite even stronger and stay the course," Guterres said during an address on climate change at New York University. "The message is simple: the sustainability train has left the station. Get on board or get left behind.\n"The real danger is not the threat to one\'s economy that comes from acting. It is instead the risk to one\'s economy by failing to act."\nTrump, who has previously called global warming a hoax, has come under concerted pressure from other world leaders to honor the pact.\nThe United States is the world\'s biggest economy and the second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China.\n"The world is in a mess," Guterres said. "It is absolutely essential that the world implements the Paris Agreement.\n"Climate change is undeniable. Climate action is unstoppable. And climate solutions provide opportunities that are unmatchable," he said, describing the effects as "dangerous and accelerating."\nHis appeal underscores the growing isolation of Trump\'s administration on an issue that unites both the closest U.S. allies and big rivals and fellow industrial powers. Big emitters led by China, the European Union and India have reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris deal.\nBy contrast, Trump wants to favor U.S. coal.\nOn Tuesday, the news site Axios reported that Trump had informed close associates that he planned to withdraw from the pact, which includes a pledge by states to strive to limit the rise of global temperatures well below 2 degrees Celsius.\nBut getting out of the pact is not easy  by design. The authors of the Paris agreement included a provision that prohibits any nation from formally invoking its right to withdraw from the pact till November 2019, three years after the treaty came into force. It would then take another year before the U.S. could formally pull out of the agreement  meaning that the United States could remain in the Paris pact until the next presidential election.\nA U.N. panel of climate scientists says it is at least 95 percent probable that man-made greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from burning fossil fuels, are the main cause of climate change since 1950.\nGlobal average temperatures have hit record highs in each of the past three years, and warming is projected to cause worsening droughts, sea level rises, floods, heat waves and extinctions of wildlife.\nCredit: From news services; The Associated Press, Reuters and Foreign Policy contributed to this report.\nCaption: White House press secretary Sean Spicer speaks during the daily press briefing at the White House in Washington, Tuesday, May 30, 2017.

Gas prices dropped as advances in drilling such as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, greatly increased the amount of gas on the market. For many utilities, that\'s made gas a more attractive fuel than coal.\nMeanwhile, companies have gotten more efficient at extracting coal, meaning fewer workers are needed to dig a given amount of fuel. Mountaintop removal mining, in which hilltops in Appalachia are blasted off with explosives to expose coal seams, is less expensive and more automated than underground mining. So are the massive strip mines developed since the 1970s in Wyoming and Montana, where conveyor belts move coal for miles across the open landscape to load onto trains.\nCoal\'s share of the U.S. power market has dwindled from more than 50 percent last decade to about 32 percent last year. Gas and renewables have both made gains, and hundreds of coal-burning power plants have been retired or are scheduled to shut down soon  trends over which Trump has limited influence.\nWESTERN RESERVES\nAbout 40 percent of coal produced in the U.S. comes from federal land in Western states. Companies operating in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana, the nation\'s dominant coal region, control enough reserves to last 20 years.\nEven before the moratorium, many mining companies were going bankrupt. The eight-state Appalachian region once dominated coal mining but now accounts for less than 25 percent of production after hundreds of mines there closed. Mines in the Midwest and South also have seen declines.\nTHE CARBON BALANCE\nLease applications blocked by the Obama moratorium involved more than 1.8 billion tons of coal from two dozen mines.\nBurning that coal would unleash an estimated 3.4 billion tons of carbon dioxide. That\'s equivalent to a year of emissions from 700 million cars. And that is just a small portion of the federal government\'s coal reserves.\nEnvironmentalists say keeping those reserves in the ground is crucial to the global effort to minimize climate change.\nCloud Peak Energy CEO Colin Marshall described Trump\'s executive orders on coal as an important step toward lifting the "punitive and ill-conceived" regulations under President Barack Obama. \nYet Marshall said more will be needed from Congress for the industry to survive long term, such as investments in so-called clean coal programs under which utilities could capture carbon from burning coal to keep it out of the atmosphere.\nCredit: Associated press\nCaption: FILE - In this Nov. 15, 2016 file photo, a haul truck with a 250-ton capacity carries coal from the Spring Creek strip mine near Decker, Mont.

Macron announced a contest for the projects in June, hours after Trump declared he would withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord.\nMore than 5,000 people from about 100 countries expressed interest in the grants. A majority of the applicants  and 13 of the 18 winners  were U.S.-based researchers.\nMacron\'s appeal "gave me such a psychological boost, to have that kind of support, to have the head of state saying I value what you do," said winner Camille Parmesan, of the University of Texas at Austin. She will be working at an experimental ecology station in the Pyrenees on how human-made climate change is affecting wildlife.\nIn an interview, Parmesan described funding challenges for climate science in the U.S. and a feeling that "you are having to hide what you do."\nTrump has expressed skepticism about global warming and said the Paris accord would hurt U.S. business by requiring a reduction in climate-damaging emissions.\n"We will be there to replace" U.S. financing of climate research, Macron told the winners in Paris on Monday.\n"If we want to prepare for the changes of tomorrow, we need science," he said, promising to put in place a global climate change monitoring system among other climate innovations.\nThe research of the winning recipients focuses on pollution, hurricanes and clouds. A new round of the competition will be launched next year, alongside Germany. About 50 projects will be chosen overall, and funded with $70 million from the state and French research institutes.\nInitially aimed at American researchers, the research grants were expanded to other non-French climate scientists, according to organizers.\nCandidates need to be known for working on climate issues, have completed a thesis and propose a project that would take three to five years.\nThe time frame would cover Trump\'s current presidential term.\nFrench officials have not revealed the value of the grants but said the amount varied by project. Senior researchers were eligible for awards of up to $1.7 million, the president\'s office said.\nCredit: SYLVIE CORBET; Associated Press\n'b'ANCHORAGE, Alaska * The administration of President Donald Trump announced Wednesday it will not list the Pacific walrus as a threatened species based on diminished Arctic Ocean sea ice, concluding that the marine mammals have adapted to the loss by foraging from coastlines.\nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials said they cannot determine with certainty that walruses are likely to become endangered "in the foreseeable future," which the agency defines as the year 2060.\nThe decision likely will be challenged in court, said Shaye Wolf, climate science director for the Center for Biological Diversity, who wrote the listing petition filed in 2008. She called the decision a misrepresentation of science to reach a predetermined conclusion.\n"They did not want to list. This is an anti-science, anti-wildlife administration that denies the reality of climate change, which is the primary threat to the walrus," Wolf said. "Admitting that the walrus is threatened by climate change acknowledges that climate change poses a real danger to people and wildlife, and they don\'t want to do that."\nWalruses in the last decade have been forced ashore in unprecedented numbers, resulting in deaths, especially of young animals, and long swims for nursing females and other walruses to find food.\n"They\'re not adapting, they\'re suffering," Wolf said.\nThe Fish and Wildlife Service said in 2011 that walruses deserve the additional protection of being declared threatened, but delayed a listing because other species were a higher priority. The agency revised the decision based on new information, said Patrick Lemons, the agency\'s marine mammals management chief in Alaska.\n"Walruses demonstrated much more ability to change their behaviors than previously thought," Lemons said. Their ability to rest on shorelines before swimming to foraging areas makes the threat of less sea ice uncertain, he added.\nBesides Pacific walrus, the Fish and Wildlife Service found that 24 other species did not warrant protections under the Endangered Species Act.\nCredit: DAN JOLING; Associated Press\nCaption: FILE - In this April 18, 2004, file photo provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Pacific walrus cows and yearlings rest on ice in Alaska.

But our withdrawal will be meaningless unless he follows up with two important actions before he leaves office. \nFirst, the administration must vacate the Environmental Protection Agency\'s 2009 "Endangerment Finding" from carbon dioxide. Under the 2007 Supreme Court case Massachusetts v. EPA, this finding is required for the Agency to regulate carbon dioxide emissions under the Clean Air Act. No finding, no policy. \nSecond, the U.S. must pull out of the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This treaty, which was ratified by the Senate, is the document that enables subsequent emissions agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol (not ratified) and the Paris agreement (an executive agreement).\nAs long as we are a party to the Framework Convention, a new president with different views on climate policy could simply sign us right back into the Paris agreement.\nFrom the periphery, and certainly from reading the headlines, canceling out these two elements of climate policy might seem like a tall task. Certainly, the climate science used to justify the EPA\'s endangerment finding and U.S. entry into the U.N. framework is seen as beyond reproach.\nOne of the foundational documents for the Endangerment Finding is the 2009 "National Assessment" of climate change. Its next iteration, in 2014, claimed it was "the most comprehensive and authoritative report ever generated about climate change," as well as being "a key deliverable of President Obama\'s Climate Action Plan."\nThe problem is, these "assessments" rely solely upon computer climate models for their future scenarios of gloom and doom. As it turns out, climate modeling (or forecasting) isn\'t necessarily climate science, because the modeler gets to choose a preferred answer, and then tune the internal equations to get there.\nThe forecast models are known as "general circulation models," or GCMs, and are generated by various government research groups around the world. Every six years, the U.S. Department of Energy supervises a "model intercomparison" project. For the most recent one, in 2013, 34 modeling teams sent in a "frozen code" model to be compared with the predictions from other groups. These form a community of base models, which the researchers feel are their "best" version, and after this point the code cannot be changed until the inter-comparison is done. \nAccording to an Oct. 2016 news story in Science magazine, the modeling team from Germany\'s Max Planck Institute was finalizing their inter-comparison version when the team leader, Erich Roeckner, became temporarily unavailable to participate in the work. As the team tested the model before submitting it, they found it now predicted twice as much warming (7 degrees Celsius) for doubled carbon dioxide as it had in its previous iteration. Science reported that Roeckner had a unique ability to tune the model\'s cloud formation algorithm, and so in his absence, the model produced heating way outside the norm. Roeckner\'s team eventually got the warming down to a level that was within the range of the other models.\nEnter Frederic Hourdin, who headed up the French modeling effort. He rounded up modelers from 13 other groups and recently published "The Art and Science of Climate Model Tuning" in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. All of the climate models the world uses to create and justify things like the U.N. Framework Convention, the EPA endangerment finding, and the Paris agreement, are "tuned" to arrive at parameters forecast within an "anticipated acceptable range," to quote Hourdin. But the big question is, acceptable to whom? One of Roeckner\'s senior scientists, Thorsten Mauritsen, told Science, "The model we produced with 7 degrees [Celsius] was a damn good model." But in his opinion that was too hot, so it had to be tuned. \nThe EPA\'s determination that carbon dioxide needs to be more strictly regulated is based entirely on the GCM\'s future climate projections, in which the subjective modeler - not the objective model - determines what is "acceptable." That\'s not science. It\'s an educated guess. It is akin to the "herding" phenomenon seen among election pollsters when they adjust unexpected (but still possibly correct) results to appear more plausible based on others\' results and expectations.\nIt will be a considerable task to document the tuning problem. But if the Trump administration does this, it will have sufficient justification to warrant vacating the Endangerment Finding, which itself will justify getting the U.S. out of the U.N. Framework Climate Convention, and out of Paris for good.\nPatrick J. Michaels is the director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute.\n'b'Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., D-Calif., issued the following news release:\nCalling for further subnational and non-state climate collaboration and action, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today convened dozens of regional and business leaders from around the world in Beijing for the Under2 Clean Energy Forum and welcomed former United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres as Global Ambassador for the Under2 Coalition.\n"This is a heroic undertaking that you are a part of and I welcome you to the Under2 Coalition," said Governor Brown in his opening remarks. "Nothing is more difficult, nothing is more important, but by being here we\'re saying we\'re up to the task. So let\'s get to work."\nAt today\'s forum, the Under2 Coalition added five new members - Denmark, the state of Chhattisgarh in India, the region of Brittany in France and the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape in South Africa. It was also announced that former UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres would serve as the Under2 Coalition\'s Global Ambassador.\n"I\'m delighted to have been named as Global Ambassador for the Under2 Coalition. It has never been more important for states and regions to work together to help promote clean energy economies and limit global temperature rises," said Under2 Coalition Global Ambassador Christiana Figueres. "To give us the best chance of staying below 2 degrees of warming, we will need to bend the curve of emissions by 2020, so I look forward to playing an active role in raising awareness of the Coalition\'s ambitions."\nThe Under2 Coalition is an international pact among cities, states and countries committed to limiting the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius, the level of potentially catastrophic consequences by either reducing their greenhouse gas emissions from 80 percent to 95 percent below 1990 levels or limit emissions to less than 2 annual metric tons per capita by 2050.\nThe coalition now includes 175 jurisdictions on six continents collectively representing more than 35 countries, 1.2 billion people and $28.8 trillion GDP - equivalent to over 16 percent of the global population and over 39 percent of the global economy.\nThe Under2 Clean Energy Forum was organized with the Climate Group, which serves as the secretariat of the Under2 Coalition and was co-hosted by Governor Brown, China\'s Ministry of Science and Technology and Sichuan Province. This forum expanded on the event Governor Brown launched last year in San Francisco during the Clean Energy Ministerial.\nAlso today, two new agreements were announced at an event in Beijing to spur greater clean technology cooperation, innovation and investment between China and California. The first agreement, between the Regents of the University of California and Tsinghua Holdings - a subsidiary of Tsinghua University, one of China\'s top colleges - will develop the California-China Clean Technology Funds. The public-private partnership will focus on accelerating investment in low-carbon and clean energy projects, companies, assets and infrastructure.\n"We look forward to demonstrating through the California-China Clean Technology Funds that meeting the world\'s Paris commitments is not only possible, but also profitable," said University of California Regents Chief Investment Officer Jagdeep Bachher.\nThe other partnership, signed by the California Energy Commission and Haidian District - home to many of China\'s high-tech and startup companies - provides incubator space and market access for California clean energy and technology companies through a new California-Beijing Clean Tech Innovation Center in the Zhongguancun High-Tech Park (Z-Park), among other measures.\nThese new pacts build on the climate agreements Governor Brown struck on behalf of California earlier this week in Beijing, Nanjing and Chengdu with China\'s Ministry of Science and Technology, Jiangsu Province and Sichuan Province, respectively.\nYesterday, Governor Brown met with President Xi Jinping for approximately 45 minutes at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing and discussed the importance of expanding cooperation on green technology, innovation and trade. Governor Brown also spoke at Clean Energy Ministerial events on electric vehicles and the economic transition to clean energy and met with Hebei Province\'s Governor and China\'s Minister of Commerce.\nTomorrow, before returning to California, the Governor will meet with the Mayor of Beijing and deliver keynote remarks at the California-China Climate Partnership Dialogue at Tsinghua University with China\'s Special Envoy for Climate Change Xie Zhenhua.\nMore information on the Governor\'s itinerary in China can be found (https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=19821).\nMSTRUCK-5886848 MSTRUCK\n'b'VATICAN CITY * Handshakes, gifts, friendly small talk and big hopes for peace. Setting aside past differences, President Donald Trump and Pope Francis put a determinedly positive face on their first meeting Wednesday at the Vatican.\nThe two global leaders, vastly different in temperament and views of the world, talked seriously and extensively in a 30-minute private meeting about terrorism, the radicalization of young people, immigration and climate change, officials said. Details were not revealed.\nBut all was upbeat in public, peace the overarching theme.\nFrancis gave Trump a medal featuring an olive branch.\n"We can use peace," said the president, acknowledging the symbolism.\nHe gave the pope a custom-bound, first-edition set of Martin Luther King Jr.\'s works, an engraved stone from the King Memorial in Washington and a bronze sculpture of a flowering lotus titled "Rising Above."\n"I think you\'ll enjoy them. I hope you do," Trump said.\nThe pope\'s other gifts offer a more pointed message, though Francis is known to give them to other visitors, too.\nHe gave Trump three bound papal documents that he has written that to some degree define his papacy and priorities. One focuses on the environment, demanding an end to a "structurally perverse" economic system that has turned Earth into an "immense pile of filth." He frames climate change as an urgent moral crisis that harms the poor the most.\nTrump has expressed skepticism about global warming and possible causes, and he has promised changes to spur more coal and oil production in the U.S.\nThe president is midway through a grueling nine-day, maiden international journey that has included Middle East stops in the cradles of Islam and Judaism. In Saudi Arabia, he addressed dozens of Arab leaders and urged them to fight extremists at home and isolate Iran, which he depicted as a menace to the region. In Israel, Trump reaffirmed his commitment to strong ties with the longtime U.S. ally and urged Israelis and the Palestinians to work harder toward peace.\nHe arrived late Wednesday in Brussels.\nWhile Trump received warm welcomes in Riyadh and Jerusalem, the reception could grow cooler now that he\'s reached Europe, site of widespread protests after his election. Climate change activists projected the words "Planet Earth First" on the massive dome of St. Peter\'s Basilica at the Vatican on Tuesday, and protests are expected when he attends a NATO meeting in Brussels and a G-7 gathering in Sicily.\nAs for the Trump-Francis relationship, during the presidential campaign the pope was sharply critical of the candidate Trump\'s pledge to build an impenetrable wall on the Mexican border and his declaration that the United States should turn away Muslim immigrants and refugees.\n"A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian," Francis said.\nTrump retorted that it was "disgraceful" for the pope to doubt his faith.\nThere was none of that on Wednesday. The visit began with a handshake after each man arrived, Trump in a lengthy motorcade, Francis in a Ford Focus.\nAfter their private meeting ended, the pontiff was introduced to members of Trump\'s delegation, including his wife, Melania, his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\nFrancis had a light moment with the first lady, asking via translator, "What do you give him to eat, potica?" referring to a favorite dessert from her native Slovenia.\nThe first lady laughed and said "Yes."\n"We had a fantastic meeting," the president said afterward. He tweeted later that it was the "honor of a lifetime."\nCredit: JONATHAN LEMIRE, NICOLE WINFIELD and JULIE PACE; Associated Press\nCaption: President Donald Trump and his wife Melania looks at Michelangelo\'s Pieta\', during their visit to St. Peter\'s Basilica at the Vatican, Wednesday, May 24, 2017.

Trump plans to submit his budget to Congress the week of March 13.\nThe proposed cuts to NOAA would also eliminate funding for a variety of smaller programs including external research, coastal management, estuary reserves and "coastal resilience," which seeks to bolster the ability of coastal areas to withstand major storms and rising seas.\nNOAA is part of the Commerce Department budget, which would be hit by an overall 18 percent reduction from its current funding level.\nThe Office of Management and Budget also asked the Commerce Department to provide information about how much it would cost to lay off employees, while saying those employees who do remain with the department should get a 1.9 percent pay increase in January 2018. It requested estimates for terminating leases and "property disposal."\nThe figures are part of OMB\'s "passback" document, a key part of the annual budget process in which the White House instructs agencies to draw up detailed budgets for submission to Congress. The numbers often change during the course of negotiations both between the agency and the White House as well as lawmakers and the administration later on. The 2018 fiscal year starts Oct. 1.\nA spokesperson for Commerce declined to comment. A White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that the process was "evolving" and cautioned against specific numbers. \nEPA REDUCTIONS\nUnder the tentative OMB plan, the EPA\'s funding would be reduced by roughly 25 percent and about 3,000 jobs would be cut  about 19 percent of the agency\'s staff.\nA spokeswoman for the EPA declined to comment, but a top official said in an internal memo that EPA leaders "will do everything in our power to protect our ability to support the mission of the agency in protecting human health and the environment." A copy of the memo from Acting Assistant Administrator Donna Vizian was obtained by the AP.\nThe White House declined to comment.\nThe draft proposal would cut the EPA\'s annual budget to $6.1 billion from about $8.2 billion. Proposed cuts include reducing the climate protection budget by nearly 70 percent to $29 million; the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative by 97 percent to $10 million; and environmental justice programs by 79 percent to $1.5 million.\nAlso targeted for steep spending rollbacks are the agency\'s monitoring and enforcement of compliance with environmental laws, as well as regional projects intended to benefit degraded areas such as the Chesapeake Bay, Puget Sound and the Gulf of Mexico. A program dealing with San Francisco Bay that received $4.8 million last year would be eliminated, as would initiatives for reducing diesel emissions and beach water quality testing.\nFormer EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy called the proposed budget "a fantasy" that ignored the EPA\'s mission to protect public health.\nCredit: FROM NEWS SERVICES\nCaption: FILE - In this March 21, 2016 file photo, the Flint Water Plant water tower is seen in Flint, Mich.

"Given the right treatment and aggressive efforts to prevent things from getting worse, I think there\'s hope."\nThe report highlighted health problems stemming from more frequent heat waves, disease spread by insects, air pollution and other woes. While the disasters have been costly, deaths haven\'t been increasing because society is doing a better but more expensive job adjusting to the changing conditions, the researchers noted.\nA team of 63 doctors, public health officials and scientists from around the world wrote what they considered the first of a regular monitoring of the health of the planet, similar to having a "finger on the pulse of the patient," said Dr. Hugh Montgomery, an intensive care specialist and director of the University College of London\'s Institute for Health and Performance.\nBased on 40 indicators, the study said "the human symptoms of climate change are unequivocal and potentially irreversible."\nWhile other disease rates are dropping, cases of dengue fever  a mosquito-borne disease  has doubled every decade since 1990 with 58.4 million cases and 10,000 deaths in 2013. Frumkin, a former environmental health director at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said climate change, which allows mosquitoes to live in more places and stay active longer with shorter freeze seasons, is part but not all of the reason.\nThe same goes for the increase in tick-borne Lyme disease in the United States, Frumkin said.\nBetween 2000 and last year, the number of vulnerable people  those over 65 or with chronic disease  exposed to heat waves increased by about 125 million, the study said.\nIt also highlighted the increasing likelihood of food shortages as climate change worsens.\nColumbia University\'s Madeline Thomson, who wasn\'t part of the study team, praised the work, saying "climate is a stress multiplier" so it is important to monitor this way.\nActing on climate can have side benefits, Frumkin said.

He said the oil company told investors it used one estimate of regulatory costs on projects, but then applied a lower estimate. That makes oil and gas projects look more profitable and less risky.\nThe accusation surfaced two days after shareholders pressed Exxon to disclose more details about how regulations designed to limit climate change would affect its business.\nAn Exxon spokesman said that the attorney general\'s charges were inaccurate and that his investigation was motivated by politics and publicity.\nSchneiderman made the accusations as he asked a state court to force Exxon Mobil Corp. to turn over more documents and witnesses for his investigation into the Texas-based oil giant.\nExxon has said that since 2007 it has applied a "proxy cost of carbon" when judging oil and gas projects. That is an estimate of the future costs of complying with regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions.\nSchneiderman charged that while the company said in 2014 that the additional regulatory cost of fossil fuel could approach $80 per ton of greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, he found evidence indicating that Exxon used lower figures but never told investors about the "secret internal" calculations.\nUnderstating regulatory costs could lead the company to push ahead with financially risky projects. Schneiderman said that if Exxon had used its publicly reported estimate instead of the lower internal figure, at least one oil-sands project in Canada would have been projected to lose money.\nOn Wednesday, investors representing 62 percent of shares voted to ask the company to disclose more about how climate-change regulations might affect its business.\nCredit: By David Koenig; Associated Press\nCaption: An Exxon Mobil Corp. gas station in Richmond, Ky. entucky, U.S., on Wednesday, April 29, 2015.

It\'s a sharp reversal from President Barack Obama\'s administration, which rejected the pipeline after deeming it contrary to national interests.\nThe officials, who weren\'t authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity, said the State Department\'s recommendation and the White House\'s final approval would occur Friday.\nThe White House declined to comment, other than to say it would offer an update Friday. State Department spokesman Mark Toner wouldn\'t reveal the decision but said the agency had re-examined Keystone thoroughly after ruling against the proposed project barely two years ago.\n"We\'re looking at new factors," Toner said. \nThe 1,700-mile pipeline, as envisioned, would carry oil from tar sands in Alberta, Canada, to refineries along the Texas Gulf Coast, passing through Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma. The pipeline would move roughly 800,000 barrels of oil per day, more than one-fifth of the oil Canada exports to the U.S.\nOil industry advocates say the pipeline will improve U.S. energy security and create jobs, although how many is disputed. Calgary-based TransCanada has promised as many as 13,000 construction jobs  6,500 a year over two years  but the State Department previously estimated a far smaller number. The pipeline\'s opponents contend the jobs will be minimal and short-lived and say the pipeline won\'t help the U.S. with energy needs because the oil is destined for export.\nTrump has championed the pipeline and backed the idea that it will prove a job creator. He invited pipeline company TransCanada to resubmit the application to construct and operate the pipeline. And he had given officials until next Monday to complete a review of the project.\nA Trump presidential directive also required new or expanded pipelines to be built with American steel "to the maximum extent possible." However, TransCanada has said Keystone won\'t be built with U.S. steel. The company has already acquired the steel, much of it from Canada and Mexico, and the White House has acknowledged it\'s too difficult to impose conditions on a pipeline already under construction.\nPortions of Keystone have already been built. Completing it requires a permit involving the State Department because it crosses the U.S.-Canada border.\nIn an unusual twist, the agency\'s recommendation won\'t come from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. The former CEO of oil company Exxon Mobil recused himself after protests from environmental groups who said it would be a conflict of interest for Tillerson to decide the pipeline\'s fate.\nInstead, Tom Shannon, a career diplomat serving as undersecretary of state for political affairs, will sign off, officials said.\nEven with a presidential permit, the pipeline will still face obstacles  most notably when it comes to the route, which is still being heavily litigated in the states. Native American tribes and landowners have joined environmental groups in opposing the pipeline.\nEnvironmental groups also say the pipeline will encourage the use of carbon-heavy tar sands oil, which contributes more to global warming than cleaner sources of energy. Obama reached the same conclusion in 2015 after a negative recommendation from then-Secretary of State John Kerry.\n"We cannot let the Trump administration undo the progress that people all over the country have made to ensure we avoid catastrophic climate change," Diana Best of Greenpeace said.\nTransCanada first applied for a permit in 2008. Years of politicking, legal wrangling and disputes over the pipeline\'s route preceded Obama\'s decision to nix the project. The various delays meant Hillary Clinton never issued a recommendation during her four years as secretary of state.\nIn rejecting Keystone, the Obama administration argued it would undercut U.S. efforts to clinch a global climate change deal that was reached weeks later in Paris.\nKerry\'s recommendation against the permit came after lengthy State Department reviews, and it was unclear what justification the agency might now use to explain the change of position.\nThe Trump administration has dropped fighting climate change as a priority and left open the possibility of pulling out of the Paris deal.\nCredit: JOSH LEDERMAN and MATTHEW LEE; Associated Press\nCaption: FILE - In this Nov. 3, 2015, file photo, the Keystone Steele City pumping station, into which the planned Keystone XL pipeline is to connect to, is seen in Steele City, Neb.

The otherwise whimsical park saved space at its highest point for a memorial walk, featuring photos and stories about the heroism, heartbreak and raw destructive force of the fires.\nDespite such somber reminders, Bentz is sticking with his plan and, like others, forging ahead, even after a National Park Service report said the conditions that let flames burn into the city could become the "new normal."\nClimate change, the report concluded, has coupled with other factors to expose more areas like the Great Smoky Mountains foothills to wildfires. The report suggests a new level of vulnerability, with sweeping implications for some of the nation\'s most revered wilderness areas and the tourism economy that surrounds them.\nBut Bentz and city and county officials are unconvinced. They say it\'s unlikely that Gatlinburg will again endure a perfect storm of factors that caused the blaze. Teens were playing with matches in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, wind whipped up to about 100 miles per hour to carry embers for miles and down powerlines to start more fires, and months of drastic drought created the perfect dry kindling.\nOther businesses are investing with the same confidence. A $35 million Margaritaville Resort is slated to open in Gatlinburg this spring. And two other hotels are already up and running since the fires.\n"I\'m a believer in climate change," said Bentz, Anakeesta\'s managing partner, who has a forestry background. "But I don\'t think we have concern about another fire coming to Gatlinburg and doing the same kind of damage."\nThough downtown Gatlinburg was essentially untouched by the fire, and Sevier County was open for business quickly afterward, it cost an extra $1 million-plus in Gatlinburg advertising and more state money to convey that to travelers.\nIt took a persistent campaign with simple messaging  "If you want to help, come visit"  to draw people back.\nMost of the damage in Gatlinburg was to residential buildings, and more than half of those were second homes or rental cabins, said Gatlinburg City Manager Cindy Ogle.\n"A lot of folks thought everything in Gatlinburg, and Sevier County burned down," said Sevier County Mayor Larry Waters.\nGatlinburg is bustling again along its downtown strip of candy kitchens, restaurants, shops, distilleries with moonshine tastings, mini-golf courses, old-time photo storefronts, and Ripley\'s Believe It or Not-brand attractions, including an aquarium.\nBut there\'s also the occasional vacant lot along the winding mountain roads, with only the foundation of a torched home left behind.\nThe area\'s tax revenues bolster its case for a comeback. Gatlinburg\'s gross tax receipts were down 36 percent in December 2016, right after the fire, compared to December 2015. This September\'s revenues were down only 2.4 percent compared to September 2016, before the fires.\nAbout 92 percent of Gatlinburg\'s destroyed properties have been cleared out ahead of the end-of-the-year deadline to do so, Ogle said. More than 500 rebuilding permits have been issued in the city and county, but at times it has been slow because there are only so many carpenters, plumbers and contractors, Ogle said.\nWaters, 64, who has lived in Sevier County his whole life, said the fires were nothing like anything he has experienced, and firefighters said it\'s the type of blaze usually seen out West. How climate change plays into it all, he said he doesn\'t know.\nStill, even though he doesn\'t think there will be a repeat of the fires, the region has to prepare for one, Waters said.\nGatlinburg\'s flood warning system, which mainly reaches downtown, is being expanded into other areas the fire torched. There will be an AM radio station for emergency purposes, and local officials won\'t have to get state emergency officials\' approval to send mobile emergency alerts, which they weren\'t able to do last year because essentially all lines of communication went down.\nAdditionally, Great Smoky Mountains National Park will undergo a $2.5 million radio communications system upgrade, seven local fire departments will receive radios and protective equipment, and an emphasis will be placed on clearing out dead and dying trees.\nAnakeesta, which opened in September, has another $8 million in projects in the works, including a scenic restaurant, mountain coaster and an amphitheater.\nBentz cleared out plenty of dead trees after the fire, revealing a breathtaking view of the mountains and Gatlinburg below that he hadn\'t planned for.\nCredit: JONATHAN MATTISE; Associated Press\nCaption: Customers sample fudge at the Fudge Shoppe in the Smokies in Gatlinburg, Tenn., Tuesday, Nov. 28, 2017, the one year anniversary of deadly wildfires that swept through the town. (Brianna Paciorka/Knoxville News Sentinel via AP)\n'b'The fossil fuel industry has been exceptionally  influential this year, persuading a receptive Trump administration  and Congress to give it weakened environmental and health  regulations, expanded mining and drilling on public lands and  greater use of coal-fired power plants.\nNow it is using the impacts of hurricanes that lashed the Houston  area and South Florida to argue for expanding its oil and gas  pipelines to assure uninterrupted supplies. \nCertainly, increased resiliency in energy infrastructure is  desirable, but we must look also to the less visible but real  damage caused by our addiction to fossil fuels. \nWhat about those new pipelines? Massive storms can inflict serious  damage on pipelines as well as on electric power grids and roads,  as we saw in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico. So the oil and gas  industry is wise to reassess the stability of current pipelines to  assure adequate supplies of fuel during and after emergencies. \nFor the same reasons, every city in the nation should rethink the  vulnerability of its infrastructure given forecasts of increased  storm severity. Many of them already are doing so as they consider  innovative urban design changes. \nBut it is equally important to reconsider the viability of our  entire energy system. Currently, about 80 percent of our energy  comes from fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas. \nIn light of the well-documented risks of climate change, confirmed  by the National Climate Assessment released this month, we need to  move toward a more diversified set of energy sources. \nFortunately, that is indeed what many nations are doing,  notwithstanding efforts by the fossil fuel industry to portray such  actions falsely as harmful to jobs or economic growth. More than  half of the electrical generating capacity the United States added  to its grid last year came from renewable energy, as did nearly  two-thirds of new global generating capacity. These developments  reflect a remarkable transformation in energy technology. \nWe could be doing even better if the Trump administration would end  its misguided actions to disguise the reality of climate change. It  continues to suppress scientific research on climate change, block  government scientists from speaking about it, and scrub federal  agency websites of its mention. \nThe administration also promotes inefficient fossil fuel sources  over clean energy. For example, Rick Perry\'s Department of Energy  is proposing a rule to increase subsidies for non-competitive and  aging coal and nuclear power plants while arguing that subsidies  for renewable energy ought to be curtailed. \nDOE says the rule enhances the "reliability and resiliency" of the  power grid. But it does not, as a DOE study makes clear. Another  nonpartisan study found that the rule could cost billions of  dollars a year while benefitting relatively few companies with  older power plants. \nTwo conclusions stand out. \nOne is that if the fossil fuel industry needs to build additional  oil and gas pipelines to minimize loss of service during  emergencies, it should do so. But federal and state governments  also should insist the industry meet reasonable requirements to  minimize environmental damage and risks to public health. \nThe second is that we should put such decisions into the context of  credible climate forecasts and the imperative to turn our energy  system in a different direction that will assure long-term public  health, safety, and economic strength. \nWe will be reliant on oil and natural gas resources for a long  time, particularly gasoline for transportation. \nEven so, it would be smart to increase funding now for research on  non-carbon energy technologies, promote them in a competitive  marketplace, and reevaluate our infrastructure to assure its  reliability in an uncertain future. \nThe sooner we recognize these challenges, the more time we have to  get it right and to help minimize what could be enormous adverse  impacts on the economy and society.\nCredit: Michael E. Kraft\n'b"To the Editor: Let's not. Well, not that you can really.\nClimate change isn't an agenda. Climate change is what is happening to the world right now. It's not the politicians, the Chinese, or the left-wing crystal-worshipping hippies who have determined this, but scientists.\nExperts that have spent many years observing our planet, and the effect that we have had on this planet. These scientists have repeatedly published in peer-reviewed journals about what exactly is climate change, what we can expect to see as a result, and what will happen if we don't do anything about it.\nRecently, the American Meteorological Society (a global leader in the fields of water, weather, and climate sciences - www.ametsoc.org) wrote a letter condemning and correcting US Energy Secretary Rick Perry's assertion that carbon dioxide doesn't cause global warming. NASA (www.nasa.org), whose mandate include studying Earth system sciences also takes the position that climate science is real.\nThese are big names.\nGlobally, thousands of scientists, scientific organizations, and groups all say the same this. Climate change is happening, and we are the leading cause. Even ecological groups are concerned with what is happening to wildlife. The reduction of ice every year on the arctic polar cap is threatening the polar bears. A symbol of pride for Canada, it's on our Toonie, we even engraved it on our Diamonds, are facing a shortage of food, and hunting grounds due to the lack of ice that is forming during the winter months.\nThe agenda you speak of isn't a grand conspiracy put in place to steal jobs & money from hard working citizens, but one very simple. Do something. Climate change is happening, regardless of your misinformed belief or war cry against it.\nThe agenda proposes to attempt to mitigate and perhaps reverse some of the damage already done, and certainly not make it any worse so that we can continue to prosper on this planet.\nI think there are real dangers associated with politicizing this debate. It calls into question the integrity of the over seven million scientists (Source: UNESCO) worldwide in all fields, whether it be meteorological, earth, or even medicine, chemists, biologists, physicists. Once you begintoquestionthescientific conclusions that keep coming back again and again with the conclusion that it is happening, you open the door to politicize and ignore science in very important fields.\nWe've seen evidence of this elsewhere, such as the anti-vaxx movement. Despite that the 1 study has been withdrawn, the scientist stripped of his credentials, and jailed, they are still able to influence thousands of parents to disregard the advice of doctors, and we are now seeing a resurgence in measles, and whooping cough. Diseases that were about to go the way of small pox, have returned and now politicians, and school administrators are forced to pass legislations and policies to protect children who rely on herd immunity from contracting a preventable disease.\nNot to mention the difficulty for our teachers to educate today's connected youth in scientific sound principles. Thesearetheonesthat get our children interested in Science and help nurture that passion so that they may choose a scientific career, but you also put into question their integrity and respect in the classroom.\nIf a child canreadorlistenabout various conspiracy theories being given credence by journalists and fringe media, they are then empowered to ignore the scientific principles that we attempt to instill upon them and outright accuse a teacher of lying or pandering to some agenda. The teacher will fail to connect to students so they can truly understand what science is at its fundamental level.\nCombating climate change also will have a positive affect on our economic region. Scientists warn that we will see an increase severe storms and unusual weather patterns, something that could adversely affect our agricultural industry.\nThe increase in severe storms has a larger chance of producing crop-destroying hail-storm. If not a storm, perhaps too much heat, and multi-year drought. Two feet of snow in July. These are the real dangers of climate change that can impact the residents in the area you purport to inform, and ultimately, are accountable to.\nMany have also decried the NDP and Liberal's attempts to fund initiatives by issuing a Carbon Tax. Many state that the tax will adversely affect oil in our province. We've had the tax since January 1st of this year, and in the first quarter of 2017, Alberta has seen a 131 per cent increase in the number of new wells drilled, and 101 per cent increase in the number of overall active wells since the same quarter last year, according to industry figures (source: CBC & Petroleum Services Association of Canada).\nThe fight against climate science doesn't mean we must abandon what has made our province prosper, we can choose and successfully reduce our affect on climate change while still maintaining our oil and gas economy. What we can also do is grow our green economy in this province to help us weather difficult economic periods within that economy. In Canada, the number of green jobs has surpassed the number of oil sands jobs. This didn't happen by eliminating oil, but by promoting and being inviting to investment in other areas as well. Unfortunately, these green jobs are nationally, and not all within Alberta. In the US, green jobs surpass fossil fuels 5-1 (Source: US. Department of Energy). This is where we need to go.\nWe need to play catch up in that industry. If we do, Alberta has the potential to become a powerful province supported by both oil & gas and green jobs. They are not mutually exclusive. With the number of tech and green companies that are finding the US less hospitable, we need to become known for more than just oil, and we can truly diversify our economy.\nLet's stop making this about someone's agenda, and make it about science.\nThank you,\nSteven L.

"I think the climate is going to survive this."\nThe German official\'s trip to California to talk climate efforts with Brown demonstrates determination of some U.S. governors, some 200 U.S. mayors, business leaders and others to keep cutting Americans\' output of climate-changing emissions from fossil fuels, Brown said.\nThat is despite Trump\'s announcement last week that he would pull the country out of the 2015 Paris global accord. Germany and almost all the world\'s other governments are still in the accord, which pledges them to curb emissions from gasoline-powered engines and other sources of carbon.\nTrump\'s declaration last week prompted a series of corresponding announcements of new climate alliances and efforts nationally by state leaders and others determined to keep up U.S. efforts overall against climate change.\nBrown, one of the United States\' highest-profile campaigners to cut carbon emissions, spoke a day after returning from a week of climate-change events in China.\n"The United States by withdrawing under Trump has taken a back seat" on fighting climate change, Brown said.

Jacoby and Pruitt claim the science is unclear. Apparently they haven\'t spoken with actual scientists. They could read publications from the National Academy of Sciences, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or the recent open letter from hundreds of scientists published in Scientific American.\nThere is no doubt that the burning of fossil fuels has caused significant changes in earth\'s atmosphere and the resulting changes in climate pose risks to animal and plant life in the oceans, spread of diseases, food production, political stability, and much more. The only uncertainties are the specifics of when and exactly how these impacts will occur  they are already taking place and will only get worse.\nIf you were driving a car and knew that the brakes were going to fail soon, would it make a difference to you if you didn\'t know exactly when they\'d break beyond repair?

The Globe regrets the error.\n'b'\nCorrection Appended\n\nWASHINGTON -- The White House is fiercely divided over President Trump\'s campaign promise to "cancel" the Paris agreement, the 2015 accord that binds nearly every country to curb global warming, with more moderate voices maintaining that he should stick with the agreement despite his campaign pledge.\nStephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\'s senior adviser, is pressing the president to officially pull the United States from the landmark accord, according to energy and government officials with knowledge of the debate. But, they say, he is clashing with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the president\'s daughter Ivanka Trump, who fear the move could have broad and damaging diplomatic ramifications.\nMr. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to tear up President Barack Obama\'s global warming policies, and on the home front he is moving aggressively to meet those pledges with deep cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency and a new E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, who is a skeptic of climate science.\nNext week, Mr. Trump plans to sign an executive order directing Mr. Pruitt to start the lengthy legal process of unwinding Mr. Obama\'s E.P.A. regulations for cutting greenhouse pollution from coal-fired power plants. Those regulations are the linchpin of the last administration\'s program to meet the nation\'s obligations to reduce climate emissions under the Paris agreement.\nWhile the president cannot, as Mr. Trump suggested, unilaterally undo a 194-nation accord that has already been legally ratified, he could initiate the four-year process to withdraw the world\'s largest economy and second-largest climate polluter from the first worldwide deal to tackle global warming. Such a move would rend a global deal that has been hailed as historic, throwing into question the fate of global climate policy and, diplomats say, the credibility of the United States.\nBut it would also demonstrate to his supporters that Mr. Trump is a man of his word, putting American coal interests ahead of a global deal forged by Mr. Obama.\nOn one side of that debate is Mr. Bannon, who as a former chief executive of Breitbart News published countless articles denouncing climate change as a hoax, and who has vowed to push Mr. Trump to transform all his major campaign promises into policy actions.\nOn the other side are Ms. Trump, Mr. Tillerson, and a slew of foreign policy advisers and career diplomats who argue that the fallout of withdrawing from the accord could be severe, undercutting the United States\' credibility on other foreign policy issues and damaging relations with key allies.\nAlthough Ms. Trump has not spoken out publicly for action to combat climate change, proponents and opponents of such action see her as an ally. Former Vice President Al Gore met with her during the Trump transition, and was ushered in by the "first daughter" to see the president-elect. The actor and activist Leonardo DiCaprio even slipped her a DVD copy of his climate-change documentary.\n"President Trump Must Not Wobble on Climate Change -- No Matter What Ivanka Says ...," blared a Breitbart post on Monday written by James Delingpole, who is close to Mr. Bannon and who leads the website\'s coverage of climate-change policy.\nMr. Trump wants to make a decision by next week, say people familiar with the White House\'s debate on the climate pact, in order to announce his executive order to undo Mr. Obama\'s climate regulations in conjunction with his plans for the Paris deal.\nAccording to leaked budget documents, the president will also propose killing off nearly two dozen E.P.A. programs, including the Obama-era Clean Power Program, climate partnership programs with local governments, Energy Star grants to encourage efficiency research in consumer products and climate-change research. Those would be part of a broader budget submission that would cut the E.P.A.\'s funding by 25 percent, to around $6.1 billion from $8.2 billion, and its staff by 20 percent.\n"If the goal is to fulfill the president\'s campaign promises and implement his agenda, there is no value in staying in Paris," said Thomas J. Pyle, an adviser to the Trump transition and the president of the Institute for Energy Research, an organization partly funded by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, who have worked for years to undermine climate-change policies.\nMr. Trump has cited Mr. Pyle\'s group as being influential in shaping his energy and climate proposals, including his campaign pledge to withdraw from the Paris deal.\n"The two greatest obstacles to a Clexit (climate exit from U.N. Paris agreement) are probably Ivanka and Tillerson," wrote Marc Morano, a former Republican Senate staff member who now runs Climate Depot, a fossil-fuel-industry-funded website that promotes the denial of climate science, in an email. "Tillerson with his \'seat at the table\' views could be biggest proponent of not withdrawing the U.S. from the agreement."\nMr. Tillerson is a former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, which, like many major global corporations, endorsed the Paris agreement. While his former company once denied human-caused climate change, it has more recently publicly acknowledged the threat posed by burning oil and supported proposals to tax carbon dioxide pollution.\nAsked during his Senate confirmation hearing about the Paris accord, Mr. Tillerson said, "It\'s important that the U.S. maintains its seat at the table about how to address the threat of climate change, which does require a global response."\nUnder the Paris agreement, every nation has formally submitted plans detailing how it expects to lower its planet-warming pollution. The Obama administration pledged that the United States would reduce its carbon pollution about 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. However, that pledge depends on enactment of Mr. Obama\'s E.P.A. regulations on coal-fired power plants, which Mr. Trump and Mr. Pruitt intend to substantially weaken or eliminate.\nBut under the Paris deal, those numerical targets are not legally binding, and there are no sanctions for failing to meet them. The primary legal requirements of the deal are that countries publicly put forth their emissions reductions targets, and later put forth reports verifying how they are meeting the targets. It would be possible for the Trump administration to stay in the deal and submit a less ambitious target.\nEven senior Republican voices in the foreign policy debate have said it may be wiser to stay in but keep a low profile.\n"There\'s really no obligation," Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview. "It doesn\'t require us to do anything. I think they may take a little time to assess whether pulling out makes sense now."\nForeign policy experts say withdrawing from Paris would have far greater diplomatic consequences than President George W. Bush\'s withdrawal from the world\'s first global climate-change accord, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.\n"I think it would be a major mistake, even a historic mistake, to disavow the Paris deal," said R. Nicholas Burns, a retired career diplomat and under secretary of state under Mr. Bush.\n"In international politics, trust, reliability and keeping your commitments -- that\'s a big part of how other countries view our country," Mr. Burns said. "I can\'t think of an issue, except perhaps NATO, where if the U.S. simply walks away, it would have such a major negative impact on how we are seen."\nThe Paris deal is more consequential than Kyoto. Unlike that pact, which required action only from developed economies, the Paris agreement includes commitments from every nation, rich and poor, to cut emissions, including China and India, the world\'s largest and third-largest polluters. Also, the science of climate change has become far more certain and the impact more visible in the 20 years since Kyoto. Each of the last three years has surpassed the previous one as the hottest on record.\nSome of the United States\' closest allies are urging the Trump administration not to pull out. In a letter to Mr. Trump after he won the election, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany wrote, "Partnership with the United States is and will remain a keystone of German foreign policy, especially so that we can tackle the great challenges of our time." They include, she wrote, "working to develop farsighted climate policy."\nAs Mr. Trump and his advisers weigh their Paris options, one proposal is gaining traction, according to participants in the debate: Mr. Trump could declare that the Paris agreement is a treaty that requires ratification by the Senate. The pact was designed not to have the legal force of a treaty specifically so that it would not have to go before the United States Senate, which would have assuredly failed to ratify it.\n"If there are camps forming in the White House, then let the people decide, the elected representatives," Mr. Pyle said. "Let\'s put the question to them."\nProponents of that idea say it could shift some of the weight of the decision from Mr. Trump to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, at least in the eyes of some foreign diplomats, and of the president\'s daughter.\n\nGet politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and in the Morning Briefing newsletter.\n\n\nCorrection: March 4, 2017, Saturday\n\nThis article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about a disagreement among aides to President Trump over the Paris climate change accord referred incorrectly to the agreement\'s legal requirements that countries publicly put forth their emissions reductions targets, and later put forth reports verifying how they are meeting the targets.

Another wants to remove Walter Dean Myers\' "Bad Boy" for using the word "penis" and a homophobic slur.\nElsewhere in Florida, some say global warming and evolution are a hoax and should not be taught in textbooks unopposed. Others say their local school\'s textbooks shortchange Islam\'s role in the world, while their opponents argue it\'s the danger posed by Muslim terrorists that\'s underexposed.\nUnder a bill passed by the Florida Legislature this year, any district resident  regardless of whether they have a child in school  can now challenge material as pornographic, biased, inaccurate or a violation of state law and get a hearing before an outside mediator.\nThe mediator advises the local school board, whose decision is final. Previously, challenges could be made by only parents to the school or district. There was also no mediator and fewer mandates. Districts must now also post online a list of all new books and material by grade level to make monitoring easier.\nThe Florida Citizens\' Alliance, a conservative group, pushed for the change, arguing that many districts ignored challenges or heard them with stacked committees, and didn\'t consider residents who don\'t have children in the schools. Members say boards rejected complaints over sexually explicit novels such as Toni Morrison\'s "The Bluest Eyes" being issued to middle school students. They also don\'t believe evolution and global warming should be taught without students\' hearing counterarguments.\nKeith Flaugh, a managing director of the alliance, said schools were using pornographic materials and textbooks that "totally distort our founding values and principles. They are teaching our kids socialism versus free markets. They are teaching our kids that the government is our nanny, the government is supposed to protect them." He also said children received a biased presentation against freedom of religion and gun rights.\nBrandon Haught, spokesman for Florida Citizens for Science, which opposed the bill, said his group was prepared to fight any challenges made against the teaching of evolution and climate change, which nearly all biologists and climatologists agree are proven facts. Haught, a high school environmental science teacher, said he is surprised social studies and English teachers have not formed similar coalitions to defend their courses.\n"The alliance is pushing their narrow ideology on the public schools in any way they can and so far they\'re meeting with success. I can\'t speak for the other academic subjects they\'re targeting, but I know beyond a doubt that their ideology when it comes to science is grossly ignorant and doesn\'t belong anywhere near a classroom," Haught said.\nBroward County Superintendent Robert Runcie, who is president of the state superintendents association, said the changes, which took effect July 1, were "cumbersome." Districts have always encouraged parents and residents to voice concerns about materials and curricula, he said, and the mediator is an unnecessary step.\nThe new law "creates a level of bureaucratic hurdle that could be disruptive to some good processes that are already in place," he said.\nSample complaints\nTo gauge the challenges made, The Associated Press recently sent public records requests to Florida\'s 67 school districts, seeking any complaints filed this year. Seven reported receiving at least one, including these notable complaints:\n* In Brevard County, home of the Kennedy Space Center, a Citizens\' Alliance couple filed challenges against elementary school social studies textbooks, alleging each has dozens of inaccuracies. They say that authors frequently ignore American exceptionalism and that the books\' assertion that global warming is caused by human activity is "blatant indoctrination." The district says no changes were made.\n* In Santa Rosa County, in the western Panhandle, a parent wants Ray Bradbury\'s 1953 novel "Fahrenheit 451" banned from schools because it contains profanity and violence. The book describes a dystopian future where firemen burn seized books after all are banned by the U.S. government.\n* In Nassau County, north of Jacksonville, a resident challenged the teaching of evolution, arguing that life was created and perhaps planted by space aliens. A hearing was held, and the mediator is preparing a report.\n* In Seminole County, north of Orlando, two parents complained that a middle school ancient history textbook had no chapter on Islamic civilization while mentioning Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism and Hinduism. The district replied that Islam was emerging during the timeframe taught and was covered in 10th grade.\n* In Duval County, which covers Jacksonville, the parent of a sixth-grade girl complained that an assigned novel, "Bad Boy" by Walter Dean Myers, is too explicit for that age group because it uses "penis" and a homophobic slur.

In fact, 2016 was the third  consecutive year of record warmth. \nThe report found that most indicators continue to portray a warming  world. Concentrations of the major greenhouse gases carbon dioxide  (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (NO2) rose to record levels  in 2016 with CO2 averaging 402.9 ppm (parts per million - or  molecules of CO2 per million molecules of atmospheric gas) for the  year. This was the first time that the annual average was over 400  ppm - a level that is 33 percent higher than anything the Earth has  seen in at least the last half million years. \nAmong a number of other high-profile measurements, the maximum  Arctic sea ice extent (reached near the end of the winter in March  2016) tied the previous year's record as the smallest in the  37-year satellite record. The minimum sea ice extent, reached at  the end of summer in September 2016, tied for second lowest extent  ever (with September 2007). \nThe climate system of Earth has so immense a reservoir of natural  variability that three consecutive record-breaking warm years  cannot be attributed merely to chance. Instead, these comprehensive  measurements constitute a clear signal of ongoing climate change  caused or influenced by human activities. \nOur nation simply must rise to meet this challenge and must do so  without delay.\nCredit: STEVEN A. ACKERMAN, JONATHAN MARTIN\nCaption: DAVID GOLDMAN, ASSOCIATED PRESS Sea ice melts on the Franklin  Strait along the Northwest Passage in the Canadian Arctic  Archipelago on July 22. Because of climate change, more sea ice is  being lost each summer than is being replenished in winters. Less  sea ice coverage also means that less sunlight will be reflected  off the surface of the ocean in a process known as the albedo  effect. The oceans will absorb more heat, further fueling global  warming.\n"b'HAMBURG, Germany * German police clashed with violent protesters Thursday in Hamburg a day ahead of the Group of 20 summit, using water cannons, pepper spray and batons to disperse marchers after some attacked them with bottles and other objects.\nThe skirmishes came hours before the two-day gathering of the world\'s top economic powers gets under way Friday morning in Germany\'s second-biggest city.\nIts host, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said she hoped the leaders would be able to find "compromises and answers" on a wide range of issues  although the prospects of finding common ground on climate change and trade were uncertain.\nThursday evening\'s protest as the G-20 leaders arrived in Hamburg was titled "G-20: Welcome to Hell," and a standoff between hardcore anti-capitalist protesters and police developed before the march itself really got going.\nPolice said they repeatedly asked some demonstrators to remove their masks, to no avail. They then decided to separate the group from the rest of the march, which they estimated at 12,000 people.\nBlack-hooded protesters attacked a police vehicle with bottles and bricks, breaking its window.\nOrganizers quickly called an end to the march after the violence broke out, police said. Skirmishes continued, with police advancing down the street with two water cannons while being pelted with bottles by a group of black-clad people.\nA nearby building was plastered with the slogan "Borderless solidarity instead of nationalism: attack the G-20." A small group on the roof set off fireworks. Police said windows at a furniture store and a bank were damaged. There was no immediate word on a number of arrests or injuries.\nMany other groups are calling for peaceful protests and are pushing the G-20 leaders for action to fight climate change and address economic disparities in the world. Some are even calling for the dissolution of the G-20 itself so the United Nations becomes the platform for such discussions.\nIn all, more than 100,000 protesters were expected in Hamburg for the summit, with some 8,000 considered part of Europe\'s violent left-wing scene, according to police.\nThe northern port city has boosted its police with reinforcements from around the country and has 20,000 officers on hand to patrol Hamburg\'s streets, skies and waterways.\nMerkel is also hoping to keep things under control inside the city congress center where the summit is being held. With guests including U.S. President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the search for compromises is expected to be challenging.\nMerkel said leaders would address regulating financial markets, fighting terrorism and pandemics and combatting climate change, among other issues. She said "free, rule-based and fair trade" will be an important issue.\n"You can imagine that there will be discussions that will not be easy," she said. "Globalization can be a win-win situation. It must not always be that there are winners and losers."\nIn the wake of Trump\'s recent decision to pull out of the Paris deal fighting climate change, the battle against global warming promises to feature prominently in discussions at the summit.\nMerkel has rejected calls from some to push for a strong "G-19" statement  without the U.S.  on climate change. That is something that Zhu Guangyao, a Chinese deputy finance minister, told reporters Thursday that Beijing also did not support.\nCredit: DAVID RISING; Associated Press\nCaption: A Police officer sprays a liquid during a protest against the G-20 summit in Hamburg, northern Germany, Thursday, July 6, 2017.

The change is most dramatic in the U.S., where coal mining rose 19 percent in the first five months of the year, according to U.S. Department of Energy data.\nThe reasons for this year\'s turnaround include policy shifts in China, changes in U.S. energy markets and India\'s continued push to provide electricity to more of its poor, industry experts said.\nWhether coal\'s comeback proves lasting has significant implications for long-term emission reduction targets, and for environmentalists\' hopes that China and India could emerge as leaders in battling climate change.\nWhile the U.S. reversal is expected to prove temporary, analysts agree that India\'s use of coal will continue to grow. They\'re divided on the forecast for China over the next decade.\nIndustry representatives say the mining resurgence underscores coal\'s continued importance in power generation, though analysts caution its long-term growth prospects remain bleak.\nThe U.S., China and India combined produce about two-thirds of the coal mined worldwide, and the latter two nations also import coal to meet demand. India\'s production expanded even during coal\'s global downturn.\n"If you look at those three countries, everyone else is irrelevant in the scheme of things," said Tim Buckley, energy finance director for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.\nBurning coal for power, manufacturing and heat is a primary source of the carbon dioxide emissions that scientists say is driving climate change. Reducing such emissions was a critical piece of the 2015 Paris climate accord that Trump announced this month he wants to exit.\nCredit: Associated Press\nCaption: FILE - In this Tuesday, Nov. 3, 2015, file photo, a worker guides a conveyor as it loads coal into a trailer truck at a coal mine near Ordos in northern China\'s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

Chief among these are the ability to enjoy and depend on a world that is healthy, thriving and beautiful. Through strenuous efforts, Missoulians have seen vast improvements to their air and water. It is with this in mind that we vehemently disagree with President Trumps recent executive order rolling back clean air and climate protections.\nScience tells us greenhouse gases are heating up the planet. Global temperatures have broken records for the last three years. Increased hospital visits and deaths caused by more forest fire smoke and intense heat waves illustrate that climate change is a public health threat. Accelerating glacier melt and increased droughts inform us that the planet's ecological balance is out of whack.\nThe president has it completely backwards.

Jacoby and Pruitt claim the science is unclear. Apparently they haven\'t spoken with actual scientists. They could read publications from the National Academy of Sciences, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or the recent open letter from hundreds of scientists published in Scientific American.\nThere is no doubt that the burning of fossil fuels has caused significant changes in earth\'s atmosphere and the resulting changes in climate pose risks to animal and plant life in the oceans, spread of diseases, food production, political stability, and much more. The only uncertainties are the specifics of when and exactly how these impacts will occur  they are already taking place and will only get worse.\nIf you were driving a car and knew that the brakes were going to fail soon, would it make a difference to you if you didn\'t know exactly when they\'d break beyond repair? No. You would stop driving and get them fixed. \nJoseph Silverman\nFlorence\n\nCorrection: Due to an editing error, a previous version of this letter misidentified the author as Jamie Hook.\n'b'"There is no hiding from climate change. It is real and it is everywhere." - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau "Global warming is a total, and very expensive, hoax!" -U.S. President Donald Trump Ah, politicians. Where would we be without them? The world apparently needs standup generalizers, men and women who are willing to sweep aside all doubt with bold declarations and policies about some of the most complex subjects known to man - even subjects about which they personally know very little. \nIt seems safe to assume that neither Prime Minister Trudeau nor President Trump have a deep understanding of climate science. But like political leaders everywhere they are required by unwritten social contract with voters and the media to declare where they stand on any number of mind-bending issues, none more mind-bending than climate change. \nHow do politicians manage to untangle the roots of climate science sufficiently to allow them to reach such categorical conclusions on either side of the issue? The answer may be simple: They don\'t. \nThe idea that the mind of a politician may be uncluttered by the details of climate science appears in a new book by Jim Prentice, the former Alberta premier who died in a plane crash last year. In Triple Crown: Winning Canada\'s Energy Future, Prentice (along with assisting author Jean-Sebastien Rioux) builds on arguments he had long held in favour of turning Canada into global energy powerhouse. As he put it in a 2010 speech: "In 2021, Canada will be an energy superpower." \nWhile energy superpowerdom looks unlikely to happen then or ever for Canada, Triple Crown is an engaging and forceful reiteration of views that Prentice held through his various careers as federal minister under prime minister Stephen Harper, as vice-chair of CIBC and then as premier of Alberta. \nOver the years he introduced the Harper government\'s coal phase-out carbon-reduction strategy and promoted a failed plan to revive the Mackenzie Valley gas pipeline. He also proposed a national industrial strategy with some enthusiasm. "We need a new model to plan a wide range of Canadian initiatives," he said in a 2012 speech. "Involved must be the federal government, the provinces, and the cities. The private sector, trade unions, and the best brains in a range of fields must be brought on board. Let\'s get on with it!" \nIn Triple Crown, Prentice has dropped the "superpower" word. In fact, he attributes it to Harper and does not mention his own frequent promotion of it over the years. In the book he instead writes that "Canada is not a global energy power. We should be, but we are not." He sounds nostalgic for Petro-Canada, which he says had great international potential but whose "global assets (have been) dismantled." New pipelines, to the West Coast and Energy East, could give Canada the global lift it needs. First Nations should be brought in as owners and partners. A national electricity strategy is needed. \nPolicy wonks, interventionists, corporate strategists, national carbon taxers, industrial planners, pipeline builders, Liberals and green/pink/red Tories will much enjoy Triple Crown, which is filled with "Let\'s get on with it" advocacy. \nBefore we all rush into action, it\'s worth taking a look at how Prentice came to his view that Canada\'s road to global energy power must encompass re-installing Canada\'s world leadership on climate policy, a role he says Canada once played back to the days of Maurice Strong and the Rio Earth Summit of 1992. It begins with the science of climate change, or rather with the lack of science: I decided long ago that I was ill equipped to debate the science surrounding climate change. \nAnyone looking for an examination of that topic will need to find another book. Of course the science is fascinating, but the truth is that no one really knows what effect anthropogenic carbon emissions will have on the planet, or when, or whether those effects are avoidable or reversible at this point. However, that doesn\'t mean we should do nothing. \nThat\'s quite a disclaimer. Prentice opposes doing nothing about an issue he admits no one really knows much about. Despite his admitted lack of knowledge, he goes further, calling climate change "the defining environmental battle of our generation." In other words, never mind the scientific uncertainty. Let\'s just get on with it and follow Maurice Strong and a parade of other political actors by imposing carbon pricing, coal bans, clean-tech and other high-risk policies on Canada and the rest of the world. \nThat\'s where we are today. From Prentice to Trudeau and on to most politicians (yes, even Trump), the merging of politics and science has created a self-propelling mutually reinforcing power machine. In the words of Brussels environmental lawyer Lucas Bergkamp, "science has become an instrument used by politicians and agencies to arm themselves with powerful arguments in complex value-laden debates about often small, remote, multi-factorial possible hazards or risks. Scientists have let the politicians hijack the scientific enterprise." \nOn the other side of the politics/science machine, writes Bergkamp, the policy process has been captured by policymakers and scientists who exploit scientific uncertainty. "Armed with science, politicians reap the added benefit of avoiding accountability for decisions. Under the guise of science, a new pseudo-science has developed that, to varying degrees, reflects values or even political, subjective opinion. Climate science is the prime example of this troublesome development." \nIn Triple Crown, Jim Prentice\'s comments on the science of climate change confirm Lucas Bergkamp\'s words, which were published less than two weeks after Prentice died in a plane crash last October.\nCredit: Terence Corcoran; National Post\n'b'BONN, Germany * A group of U.S. states, cities, businesses and universities said Saturday that they were still committed to curbing global warming even as President Donald Trump\'s administration is walking away from the Paris climate accord.\nBut the alliance, which has an economy larger than Japan and Germany combined, acknowledges that it won\'t be able to achieve the necessary cut in greenhouse gas emissions without some efforts at the federal level.\n"It is important for the world to know, the American government may have pulled out of the Paris agreement, but the American people are committed to its goals, and there is nothing Washington can do to stop us," former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg said at a global climate meeting in Bonn, Germany.\nGov. Jerry Brown of California echoed those comments.\n"In the United States, we have a federal system, and states have real power, as do cities. And when cities and states combine together, and then join with powerful corporations, that\'s how we get stuff done," he said.\nHis speech was briefly interrupted by anti-coal and anti-fracking protesters, who held up banners and shouted, "We\'re still in! Trump\'s still out!"\nThe group calling itself "America\'s Pledge" said states, cities and private groups had been taking considerable steps to reduce emissions by promoting renewable energy use and climate-friendly transportation systems.\n"This is a pledge, and it\'s a pledge that you can cash, because it\'s real," Brown said. "We are doing real stuff in California."\nIn a report, however, the group said that "we cannot underscore strongly enough the critical nature of federal engagement to achieve the deep decarbonization goals the U.S. must undertake after 2025."\nDaniel Firger, one of the report\'s contributors, said it was intended to show that many in the U.S. aren\'t prepared to wait for Trump to change his mind on climate change again or wait for the next administration to tackle the issue.\n"The good news around Trump\'s announcement to withdraw is that it has galvanized a groundswell of bottom-up support from all corners of the U.S. economy," Firger said.\nCities, regions and businesses in other nations around the world could look to the group for inspiration and support, he said, noting that the lessons learned by local authorities and businesses in the U.S. could be applied elsewhere.\nMERKEL BACKS EFFORTS\nAlso Saturday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in her weekly podcast that every country needed to pitch in to keep global temperatures from rising.\nMerkel also said it was the responsibility of the industrial countries to develop environment-friendly technologies that are future-oriented but "don\'t lead to a loss of jobs."\n"We don\'t gain anything if steel mills, aluminum plants and copper mills leave our countries and go somewhere else where environmental regulations are less strict  because then we haven\'t made any gains for world climate," she noted.\nCredit: FRANK JORDANS and DOROTHEE THIESING; Associated Press\nCaption: Demonstrators costumed as U.S. President Donald Trump and polar bears protest against the climate change during climate conference COP in Bonn, western Germany, Saturday, Nov. 11, 2017.

It looks at agriculture, energy costs, labor costs, coastal damage from rising seas, crime and deaths, then estimates the effect on average local income by the end of the century.\nResearchers computed the possible effects of 15 types of impacts for each county across 29,000 simulations.\n"The South gets hammered, and the North can actually benefit," said study lead author Solomon Hsiang, a University of California economist. "The South gets hammered primarily because it\'s super-hot already. It just so happens that the South is also poorer."\nThe southern part of the nation\'s heartland  such as Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kentucky and Southern Illinois  also feels the heat hard, he said. Michigan, Minnesota, the far northeast, the northwest and mountainous areas benefit the most. The study team created an interactive map of their findings.\nThe county hit hardest if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated is tiny and impoverished Union County in Florida, where median income would take a 28 percent hit. And among counties with at least 500,000 people, Polk County in central Florida would suffer the most, with damages of more than 17 percent of income.\nSeven of the 10 counties with the highest percentage of projected county income losses from climate change are in Florida, along with two in Texas and one in Georgia.\nHalf of these are among the poorest counties in the country.\nFive of the 10 counties that would benefit the most from global warming are in Michigan. The others are in Alaska, Colorado, Nevada and the mountainous region of North Carolina. Mineral County in Nevada would see a 13 percent increase in income, while Tacoma, Washington\'s Pierce County would benefit by about 2 percent, the most among counties with a population of more than 500,000.\n"You\'re going to see this transfer of wealth from the Southeast to the parts of the country that are less exposed to risk," said study co-author Robert Kopp, a Rutgers University climate scientist. "On average both in this country and on this planet just poorer people are in hotter areas."\nThe whole nation\'s gross domestic product would shrink by 0.7 percent hit for every degree Fahrenheit temperatures go up, the study calculates.\nCredit: SETH BORENSTEIN; AP Science Writer\nCaption: FILE - In this June 22, 2017, file photo, beachgoers enter the water even though double-red flags are flying, warning of dangerous conditions and extremely rough surf in the remnants of Tropical Storm Cindy, in Seaside, Fla.

But the threat by President Donald Trump\'s administration to pull the U.S. out of the agreement and extreme weather events in many parts of the world have created pressure for other governments at the meeting to strongly affirm their support for the 2015 Paris accord.\nMuch of the limelight Wednesday is expected to fall on Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, which is co-hosting the U.N. talks in Bonn with Fiji. Environmental campaigners want Germany to show its commitment to curbing global warming by announcing a deadline for phasing out the burning of coal, a major contributor to greenhouse gases.\nPresident Hilda Heine of the Marshall Islands, whose country risks being swallowed by the Pacific Ocean , said a declaration that Germany will end its use of coal "would be a signal of hope for my country and for every vulnerable country around the world."\nMerkel will be joined by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and French President Emmanuel Macron, who has come out strongly in favor of efforts to fight climate change since taking office this year.\nStill, with Trump saying he wants to withdraw from the Paris treaty, scientists warn it will be difficult to achieve the central goal of keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century.\nA group of U.S. states, cities and businesses that back the Paris accord have become the go-to contacts for many negotiators in Bonn who remain eager to work with the United States.\nWashington\'s official delegation has been largely invisible at the talks, save for a U.S.-sponsored event promoting fossil fuels and nuclear energy late Monday that drew vocal protests from environmental campaigners.\nThe talks have also seen dozens of announcements from businesses and governments that pledged to reduce emissions or to commit large sums of money to helping poor countries tackle the effects of climate change.\nThe meeting, which is scheduled to end Friday, is aimed at producing draft rules for implementing the Paris accord. The rules would need to be finalized by the time of next year\'s global climate talks in Poland.\nCredit: FRANK JORDANS; Associated Press\nCaption: At least 1,200 candles spell out an environmental message in front of a building close to the German federal parliament in Berlin, where German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other politicians met Tuesday.

(Heiko Junge/NTB scanpix via AP)\n'b'BONN -- At the 23rd Conference of the Parties (COP 23), where thousands of diplomats and heads of international organisations are currently negotiating the guidelines for the Paris Agreement, a large group of young Arab leaders are filling the halls, galvanised by their potential role in climate action.\nYoungsters, who represent more than a third of the Arab world\'s population, aim to establish their role in the ongoing negotiations. "We want to be part of the shaping process of our future," said a group of young environment activists at the event held in Bonn, Germany.\nDisplaying a great sense of awareness of what has been accomplished over the past years in the fight against climate change and of what still needs to be done, the Arab youth are pushing for their region to be more "accountable".\nSafa Jayoussi, a Jordanian youngster who heads the climate and energy campaigns at IndyACT, said that Arab youth are advocating with other young activists from around the world for loss and damage adaptation.\n"We are also advocating for more financing of mitigation and adaptation projects in our region and this is of high importance," Jayoussi, who is also a board member at the Climate Action Network, said.\nThe environment activist said that young Arabs are progressively "maturing" in climate action, especially in the last two years.\n"Many of these young people are becoming a source of information for Arab delegations in climate change negotiations. Many times, they have served as a link between policymakers and experts; therefore, more Arab delegations are inviting young environment activists to join their countries\' official delegation," Jayoussi told The Jordan Times on the sidelines of COP 23.\nBut, despite this increased participation, Jayoussi said that policymakers are still addressing the youth as "a target audience".\n"In the official decision making, we are still not really in," she stressed.\nWorld nations are currently drafting out the operating guidelines for the Paris Agreement that will detail how nations can reach the goals agreed upon, including the limitation of global warming to 1.5oC or 2oC at the most by the end of the century.\nMousa Sheikh, a young Jordanian environment engineer, took a two-week leave from his job in a private sector firm, to join his colleagues at YOUNGO, a youth climate movement that delivers interventions at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change process.\n"The Arab youngsters and the youth in general should be involved in the core of the climate negotiations because what is being discussed is our future too," Sheikh said.\nHe underscored that the Arab youth at COP 23 are interested in understanding more about the mitigation of impacts of climate change and the financing mechanism and opportunities.\nFor Tareq Hassan, an environment activist from Yemen, attending COP 23 is "pivotal" for monitoring what the Arab delegations are pitching.\n"We are here for many reasons, including to push the Arab governments to include the environment problems of the Arab world in their official statements as the conference proceeds," Hassan said.\nThe founder of the Arab Youth Network for Sustainable Development and member of the Arab Youth Climate Movement said that he quit his job in an international humanitarian organisations earlier this year to promote activism in sustainable development.\n"We want to build a young generation in the Arab region that is fully aware of what climate change is doing to our countries. We inform them about COPs and try to create ambassadors of sustainable development in the Arab region," Hassan said.\nThe activist highlighted that there is a gap between young Arab environment activists and some Arab delegations participating in COPs, underscoring that Arab young leaders in environment and climate action have a great role in attaining the sustainable development goals and empowering the young generation.\nMeanwhile, Ahmad Noubani, an expert on climate change actions for the Ministry of Environment in Jordan, said that having a young generation in the Arab world that is aware of the world environment status and involved in climate change negotiations creates "responsible policymakers for the future".\n"Arab young activists can be observers now but, in five or ten years, they can become the decision makers who are directly involved in global environment negotiations," Noubani said, highlighting the importance of enrolling the Arab youth in environment and climate change talks and processes.\nLebanese Nuhad Awwad is acting as an observer in this year\'s COP. "This year, I am observing what the Arab countries are pitching. We are following up on what is happening at meetings and negotiations, including financing... In addition, we are going to all the events to create partnerships with leading groups that can come to Arab countries and apply their initiatives, like in the renewable energy field," said Awwad, who is a member at the Arab Youth Climate Action and the Mediterranean Youth Network on Climate Change.\nHowever, this year\'s participation of the Arab youth is lower, Awwad said, urging Arab governments to engage the youth in climate change policymaking.\nArab governments should build the capacity of their youth by training them on climate change and inviting them to be part of the official delegations which will enrich Arab countries\' participation at climate talks, she said.\n"We play a role in raising the awareness of our communities... but we are not having a say in policymaking," Awwad pointed out.\nLebanese-American Rawan Chaya, an intern with Climate Action Network joining COP for the first time, said that COP 23 and its goals "hit home, particularly regarding the environmental injustices plaguing Lebanon".\n"As an environmentalist living in the Arab region, I feel uneasy for upcoming generations. I believe that in order for climate change to be tackled as effectively as possible, it is important that countries all over the globe implement environmental awareness within school curricula," Chaya said.\n Copyright The Jordan Times.

Jon Tester recently gave a great speech to the U.S. Senate about our warming climate, hurricanes and wildfires. Thank you, Senator Tester, for asking your fellow senators not to bury their heads in the sand when it comes to the effects of climate change.\n\nMike Garrity,\n\n\nexecutive director,\n\n\nAlliance for the Wild Rockies,\n\n\nHelena\n\n'b'The office of Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., issued the following news release:\nOregon\'s Senator Jeff Merkley today announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee has passed his amendment to the 2018 State and Foreign Operations funding bill, restoring full U.S. funding for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\nThe amendment passed with bipartisan support by a vote of 16-14.\n"It\'s critical that America has a seat at the table when it comes to international climate policy," said Merkley. "Climate disruption is the biggest challenge our planet faces in the 21st century, and we can\'t afford to be missing in action. While we still have much more work to do to get to the bold climate action we need, today\'s vote shows that Democrats and Republicans are prepared to work together to keep America engaged in the international dialogue on climate."\nMerkley\'s amendment adds $10 million to the 2018 State and Foreign Operations bill for the UNFCCC and IPCC, bringing funding levels in line with recent U.S. support for those institutions.\nThe U.S. Senate ratified the UNFCCC in 1992 by a unanimous vote. The U.S. is still a party to the UNFCCC treaty regardless of its status in the Paris Agreement, and part of keeping America\'s seat at the table is continuing to contribute these funds to the convention.\nThe IPCC is a UN entity tasked with assessing the latest climate science, and is the chief global scientific body that assesses the present state of climate science. Its Nobel Prize-winning work is central to our understand of how the climate is changing and why. This amendment continues the United States\' historical level of support for international climate science.\nThe next steps for the 2018 State and Foreign Operations funding bill would be to be passed by the full Senate, and then combined with the House version of the bill before being passed into law and signed by the President.\nMSTRUCK-5983460 MSTRUCK\n'b'PLAINS, Ga. * Former President Jimmy Carter said that Wednesday millions of jobs could be created in the United States if President Donald Trump embraced renewable energy sources such as geothermal, solar and wind power.\nCarter, a Democrat who was the first U.S. president to install solar panels at the White House, said he hoped the Republican Trump would give it "deep consideration."\n"Sometimes there\'s a philosophical objection to this by some  I\'ll say right-wing Republicans  but he has a high priority of job creation," Carter said in an interview . "If they just remember the tremendous potential of creating millions of jobs in America just from renewable energy sources, that would be a very good counter-argument to those who oppose the concept of global warming being caused by human activity."\nTrump has sent mixed signals on whether he will try to slow Earth\'s warming temperatures and rising sea levels. During the transition, Trump met with prominent climate activists Al Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio, but he has also appointed oil industry champions who want to reverse President Barack Obama\'s efforts to rein in emissions.\nThe vast majority of peer-reviewed studies and climate scientists agree the planet is warming, mostly due to man-made sources. Under Obama, the U.S. dramatically ramped up production of renewable energy from sources such as solar, in part through Energy Department grants.\nOn Wednesday, a group of senior Republican statesmen, led by former Secretary of State Jim Baker, went to the White House to gain Trump administration support for a tax on carbon to help lessen the effects of climate change.\nThe plan would place a new tax on oil, natural gas and coal and then use the proceeds to pay quarterly dividends to American taxpayers. They said the payments would amount to about $2,000 total each year for families.\nIn addition to Baker, former Secretary of State George Shultz and other former officials from the administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush support the effort, billed as the Climate Leadership Council.\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer declined Tuesday to comment on whether Trump might consider supporting such a plan.\nCredit: ALEX SANZ; Associated Press\nCaption: Former President Jimmy Carter, right, and his wife Rosalynn arrive for a ribbon cutting ceremony for a solar panel project on farmland he owns in their hometown of Plains, Ga., Wednesday, Feb. 8, 2017.

"We believe that we must cooperate, that protectionism is not the correct answer."\nMerkel stressed there is too much "national egoism" at the moment and that the World Economic Forum\'s motto of "creating a shared future in a fractured world" was "exactly right" for 2018.\nConcerns that the U.S. is turning its back on the globalization  which many credit with increasing wealth but also creating inequality  were accentuated this week, when Trump backed new tariffs on imported solar-energy components and large washing machines. His combative commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, conceded Wednesday that China could respond by imposing its own tariffs on U.S. products.\n"There\'s always potential for retribution or retaliation and that\'s up to the Chinese to decide," Ross told journalists as part of the largest-ever U.S. delegation to Davos. He warned that the U.S. itself could respond to any retaliation from Beijing.\nThe chorus of criticism of Trump\'s commercial policies is unlikely to sway Trump, especially when recited by governments that often maintain more trade barriers than the United States.\nExperts note that countries such as China have higher barriers to trade than the U.S. Even the European Union has been accused of pursuing protectionist trade policies to defend its own interests, particularly in agriculture and in industry.\n"Trade wars are fought every single day," Ross added. "Unfortunately, every single day there are various parties trying to violate the rules, and trying to take unfair advantage of things  the difference is that U.S. troops are now coming to the ramparts."\nThe "America First" view that underpins the Trump economic program has already seen the U.S. withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal with 11 countries, and seek a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. Trump has also pulled the United States out of the Paris agreement on climate change, a move that reinforced fear that "America First" means the U.S. turns inward and opts for a more isolationist approach.\nWhile acknowledging that it is legitimate for each leader to say "My country first," Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said trade was the means towards economic growth  and that protectionism ran counter to that.\nTrump is due to address the Davos elites Friday, and there is concern among some participants about what his economic and trade policies could do to the global economy, which is growing at its strongest rate in years.\nTrump\'s visit has sparked scattered, small protests in Switzerland, and some participants among the 3,000 on hand say he\'s not welcome because of his controversial tweets, nationalistic tack and trade policies.\nCredit: JAMEY KEATEN and PAN PYLAS; Associated Press\nCaption: German Chancellor Angela Merkel looks to the audience during her special address as part of the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Wednesday, Jan. 24, 2018.

The plan involves using a "back-and-forth critique" by experts recruited by the federal government, similar to the way the military identifies field operation vulnerabilities.\nBelow is a statement by Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n"No one should be fooled by Scott Pruitt\'s reported proposal to launch a review of climate science. Climate science has undergone comprehensive and painstaking scientific peer review for decades. Since 1988, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has worked with literally thousands of scientists worldwide to synthesize the most recent climate science findings for world leaders every five to seven years. The U.S. National Academy of Sciences delivered a comprehensive report on the topic in 2014. Mr. Pruitt knows this. The real purpose of Pruitt\'s gambit is to lay the groundwork for EPA to overturn the finding it made in 2009 that greenhouse gases endanger our health and safety. Mr. Pruitt tried to do this in court unsuccessfully when he was an attorney general in Oklahoma. He is now at it again. Why?  Because under the Clean Air Act, he can\'t erase climate change regulations without overturning this finding. That is what this is all about."\nMSTRUCK-5923923 MSTRUCK\n'b'If a repeat of the Great Potato Famine was to strike or climate change so altered the Earth that water became scarce, potato seeds from the U.S. gene bank on the outskirts of Sturgeon Bay could provide the solution to a looming food crisis.\nWhile that seems far-fetched or outlandish, it\'s not. A potato fungus about 15 years ago threatened crops around the nation. Potato seeds from Sturgeon Bay were among the tools used to avert a potato crisis. \nThe fungus, called late blight, was a variation of the disease that caused the Great Potato Famine, leading to failed crops and starvation in Ireland and parts of Europe from 1845 to 1852. It also caused mass migration to the United States. \nGeneplasm, or potato seeds, from the Sturgeon Bay facility were used to develop a potato immune to the new form of late blight, said John Bamberg, a plant geneticist with the USDA/ Agriculture Research Service and project leader of the U.S. gene bank. The gene bank is located at the Peninsular Agricultural Research Station along Highway 42. \n"For years we knew that there was a Mexican species that was resistant to late blight, and researchers had been working on it using seeds from our gene bank," Bamberg said. \nWhen it was discovered the new form of late blight was resistant to sprays used to control the fungus, researchers went into action to develop a potato variant based on the Mexican plant that was immune. \n"A lot of people don\'t know about the important work being done right here in Sturgeon Bay," Bamberg said. \nIn the greenhouses at the U.S. Potato gene bank, lush green tendrils of potato plants reach toward the grow lights. The mature plants sprout pods the size of walnuts that yield valuable pinhead-size seeds. \nThese seeds hold the clues for scientists seeking answers to a wide range of topics, including higher yield, drought-resistant and pesticide-free potatoes. The world\'s largest collection of potato seeds and cultivars are housed at the U.S. Potato gene bank, representing more than 5,000 potato varieties and species. \nPotatoes can grow almost anywhere, need less water than most food sources and are packed with nutrients, antioxidants and minerals, Bamberg said. Researchers around the world are working to develop new potato strains to feed burgeoning populations in areas where the soil is poor and the climate is cold, hot or dry. \n"In a world where the climate is changing, potatoes are an adaptable crop," Bamberg said. \nPotatoes are a super-food, Bamberg said. There are not many food sources as easy to cultivate, with the same tastiness and providing similar nutrient and mineral benefits as potatoes, he said. \nRecently scientists at a facility in Peru that partners with the Sturgeon Bay site completed experiments where they successfully grew potatoes in a climate similar to Mars. Growing potatoes in an adverse climate like Mars demonstrates the potential for potato crops, Bamberg said. \n"It\'s similar to climate change where what you used to grow, you can\'t anymore, so maybe potatoes are the answer," he said. "Potatoes are already an important food crop, and as the climate is changing, there\'s a need to meet the new challenges in growing the crop." \nThey also are the most widely grown and consumed vegetable in the nation with a value of $4.3 billion and exports totaling more than $1 billion. In the world, potatoes rank behind wheat, rice and corn in consumption. \nChina is quickly surpassing the United States in potato production, and India is not far behind, Bamberg said. \nVast varieties of potatoes, many developed with gene-plasm from Sturgeon Bay, are being cultivated across Asia, India and into Southeast Asia. \n"These countries have large populations, and they need to feed their people," he said. \nThe gene bank\'s goal is to help researchers and breeders innovate improvements in the potato crops, said Tina Wagner, a lab technician who maintains the facility\'s collection. \nThrough genetics, the opportunities to develop potato crops with certain traits is significant. The gene bank specializes in providing researchers with the seeds or germ plasm that have traits a scientist requires to develop certain characteristics in a potato, Wagner said. \n"We have a job to do, and one of those things is filling the orders," Wagner said. \nWhile the majority of the research is U.S.-based, Wagner has shipped gene plasm to far-flung places such as the University of Inner Mongolia. \n"There\'s a lot of research going on all over the world," she said. \nThe Sturgeon Bay gene bank was founded in 1948 by Wisconsin potato-growers who saw the value in a centralized location to store seeds and house research to develop better potato stock. \nEvery year, Bamburg and other researchers scour the sites where wild potatoes grow in the Western Hemisphere. While the wild potato originated in the region along the intersection of Peru and Bolivia, new wild varieties continue to be found in the southwestern section of the United States. \nWild potatoes, many of which are inedible, carry a treasure trove of genetic diversity for potentially useful traits to develop new varieties of potatoes, Bamberg said. \n"It\'s those genes from the wild potatoes. You never know what you could find," he said. \nPotato gene research has found properties in wild potatoes that could affect cancer, diabetes and obesity. There also might be benefits in potatoes to minimize the effect of lead poisoning on children, he said. \n"The research being done using gene plasm from Sturgeon Bay isn\'t just about growing a better potato. It\'s also about helping the world," Bamberg said.\nCredit: LIZ WELTER Marshfield News-Herald\nCaption: TINA M.

The female flower\'s stigma is then dipped in the capsule to complete pollination.\n'b'Climate science has failed public policy, respected and disenchanted  climate scientist Judith Curry  argued to the US Congress this week.\nDr Curry deconstructed the history of climate science to claim that the singular focus on research corralled by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change into man-made causes destroyed the usefulness of the science from the beginning.\n"Motivated by the mandate from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to  address dangerous human-caused climate change, the climate community has worked for more than 20 years to establish a scientific consensus on human-caused  climate change, which has prematurely elevated a scientific hypothesis to a ruling theory," she told House Science committee.\nAt the same hearing, Alabama\'s State Climatologist John R. Christy proposed a levy to fund research into alternative hypotheses.\n"Since the IPCC activity is funded by US taxpayers, then I propose that 5 to 10 per cent of the funds be allocated to a group of well-credentialed scientists to produce an assessment that expresses legitimate, alternative hypotheses that have been marginalised, misrepresented or ignored in previous IPCC  reports," Professor Christy said.\n"Such activities are often called red-team reports and are widely used in government and industry. In other words, our policymakers need to see the entire range of findings regarding climate change." Feeling an imposed consensus has become so entrenched, Dr Curry retired early in January from Georgia Tech, as emeritus professor of earth and atmospheric sciences. She is also president of Climate Forecast Applications Network.\n"A deciding factor was that I no longer know what to say to students and post-docs regarding how to navigate the craziness in the field of climate science," she told the committee.\n"Research and other professional activities are professionally rewarded only if they are channelled in certain directions approved by a politicised academic establishment -- funding, ease of getting your papers published, getting hired in prestigious positions, appointments to prestigious committees and boards, professional recognition, etc.\n"How young scientists are to navigate all this is beyond me, and it often becomes a battle of  scientific integrity versus career suicide." She said the challenges to climate research have been made more difficult by scientists who played power politics with their expertise to silence scientific disagreement by denigrating those who did not agree with them.\n"Sound argument doesn\'t need to denigrate its opponents," Dr Curry said. She slammed  professional societies that wrote policy  statements endorsing the consensus and advocating for specific policies.\nProfessor Christy\'s said  observed warming had been significantly less than predicted by models. "If one follows the scientific method ... the average model trend fails to represent the actual trend of the past 38 years by a highly significant amount," he said. "As a result, applying the  traditional scientific method, one would accept this failure and not promote the model trends as something truthful about the  recent past or the future." Rather, the scientist would  return to the project and seek to understand why the failure  occurred.Dr Curry said current global climate models "are not fit" for the purpose of attributing the causes of recent warming or for predicting global or regional  climate change on timescales of decades to centuries, with any high level of confidence.\nCredit: Andrew L. Urban\n'b'BEIJING * Led by cutbacks in China and India, construction of new coal-fired power plants is falling worldwide, improving chances climate goals can be met despite earlier pessimism, environmental groups said this week.\nA joint report by the groups CoalSwarm, the Sierra Club and Greenpeace follows a warning this week by two international agencies that the world needs to shift quickly away from fossil fuels to curb global warming. Environmentalists were dismayed by President Donald Trump\'s U.S. government budget proposal last week that would cut spending on renewable energy.\nConstruction starts for coal-fired plants in China and India were down by 62 percent in January from a year earlier while new facilities starting operation declined 29 percent, according to the report. It said older plants in the U.S. and Europe are being retired at a record pace. The latest developments "appear to have brought global climate goals within feasible reach, raising the prospect that the worst levels of climate change might be avoided," said the report. It acknowledged "the margin for error is tight" and said sustained progress will require China and India to scrap more than 100 coal plants on which construction has been suspended.\nIn a separate report, the U.S.-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said falling demand in Japan means most of the 45 coal plants the country has planned will likely never be built.\nThe reports mark a shift in sentiment from six months ago, when environmentalists warned governments were doing too little to carry out the Paris climate accord. Signed by 170 countries, it calls for holding global temperature increases to no more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit in hopes of preventing sea level rise and other change.\nChina, the biggest greenhouse gas emitter, said at that time that its coal use would rise until 2030. But later data showed the peak was reached in 2013 and consumption is falling.\nCountries including China, Germany, India and Japan are moving away from coal as alternatives get cheaper, said Tim Buckley, IEEFA\'s director of energy finance studies.\nDespite such changes, the amount of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rose to a new high last year and is increasing, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Asia alone is expected to account for 70 to 80 percent of the global growth in coal-fired power capacity over the next two decades.\nIndustry experts cautioned that countries including India, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Vietnam need to keep adding coal power because it is the only affordable option in a region where 500 million people lack access to electricity. The cost of solar and wind have fallen by up to 80 percent in some markets, but in places such as Bangladesh or parts of China it can still be double that of coal.\n"We have to meet the basic needs of people while pushing for energy transition ," said Yongping Zhai, an adviser on energy to the Asian Development Bank.\nCredit: JOE McDONALD and KATY DAIGLE; Associated Press\nCaption: FILE - In this Dec. 3, 2009 file photo, a Chinese boy cycles past cooling towers of a coal-fired power plant in Dadong, Shanxi province, China.

On average, Montana is now warmer and drier than it was in the 1970s, and the Union of Concerned Scientists estimates that wildfire season is two months longer as a result.\nThe costs of wildfire fighting have skyrocketed too - up fourfold nationwide in just the past 20 years. In 2013, Montana spent $57 million to fight fires. This year, weve already spent $44.5 million, and we still have a lot dry, hot days ahead of us.\nClimate inaction is expensive, and we will continue to pay for years to come.

Trump and members of his Cabinet have publicly expressed doubts that the warming is being primarily driven by man-made carbon pollution and will have serious consequences for Americans.\nAn early version of the report, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press, was distributed widely in December for review by leading scientists. The New York Times published a copy Monday.\nThe U.S. Global Change Research Program, which will edit and produce the final report, did not respond to phone and emails seeking comment on Tuesday.\nThe assessment has generally been released every four years under a federal initiative mandated by Congress in 1990. The current draft, targeted for release later this year, largely builds on the conclusions of the 2014 assessment released under the administration of President Barack Obama.\nThe assessment said global temperatures would continue to rise without steep reductions in the burning of fossil fuels, with increasingly negative impacts. Worldwide, 15 of the last 16 years have been the warmest on record. Today, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said 2017 was on track to be the second warmest for the United States.\nThe report calls the long-term evidence that global warming is being driven by human activities "unambiguous."\n"There are no alternative explanations, and no natural cycles are found in the observational record that can explain the observed changes in climate," the report said, citing thousands of studies. "Evidence for a changing climate abounds, from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans."\nScientists from all over the world have documented warming in the air and water, melting glaciers, disappearing snow, shrinking sea ice and rising sea levels. The report said the United States would see temperature increases of at least 2.5 degrees over the next few decades, even with significant cuts to carbon pollution.\nEven if humans stop spewing heat-trapping gases today, the world will warm another half a degree over today\'s temperatures, the report said, citing confidence in those calculations. Scientists, such as Stanford University\'s Chris Field, say that even a few tenths of a degree of warming can have dramatic impacts on human civilization and the environment.\n"Every increment in warming is an increment in risk," said Field, who wasn\'t part of the report but reviewed it for The National Academy of Sciences.\nTrump, who has called climate change a "total con job" and "hoax" perpetrated to harm U.S. economic competitiveness, has spearheaded a wholesale scrapping of Obama-era initiatives that sought to reduce carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants and other sources. Last week, Trump\'s administration formally told the United Nations that the U.S. intends to pull out of the 2015 Paris climate accord, in which nearly 200 nations pledged to reduce carbon emissions.\nU.S. climate scientists have watched these policy developments with increasing alarm, with some expressing concern that Trump\'s administration might seek to bury or water down the quadrennial climate assessment.\nHowever, four co-authors of the federal climate assessment, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue, said they had not heard of nor witnessed any attempt by the White House to suppress the scientific document.\n"It was under the radar, and we were fine about that," one author said Tuesday.\nMichael MacCracken, a scientist who headed the interagency team that reviewed the assessment in the 1990s, said the concerns about potential censorship were based on what senior administration officials have said they believe  that predictions of global disruptions from severe storms, droughts and heat waves are overblown and alarmist.\n"Science is not a set of beliefs," MacCracken said. "Science is a set of evidence."\nHe said he worried that the report could be late because the White House Office of Science Technology Policy, which helps coordinate the report, is understaffed and Trump has not yet appointed a science adviser.\nThe report is currently in its fifth draft. The version reviewed by the Times and AP is marked as the third review, which was released for comment in December.\n"This one was made widely available for public review," MacCracken said. "It wasn\'t a leaked review."\nOne report author said that because the assessment looks at how rising sea levels, extreme weather and other things that affect global warming can change with the amount of heat-trapping gases spewed by human society, the overriding message was how actions now on carbon dioxide pollution could limit damage in the future.\n---\nEFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON U.S., MIDWEST \nOVERALL (contiguous 48 states)\n* The annual average temperature is already 1.18 degrees warmer the last 30 years than it was from 1901 to 1960, with daytime highs 1 degree warmer and nighttime lows 1.35 degrees higher.\n* If carbon pollution continues unabated, temperatures are projected to rise another 4.83 degrees by midcentury and 8.72 degrees by the end of the century, or a few degrees less if emissions are cut somewhat.\nMIDWEST (Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa and Missouri)\n* The annual average temperature has already gone up 1.18 degrees over what it was from 1901 to 1960 and is projected to rise another 5.29 degrees by midcentury and 9.49 degrees by the end of the century, if carbon pollution continues unabated. If carbon emissions are somewhat reduced, the annual temperature would go up by 4.21 degrees by midcentury and 5.57 degrees by late century.\n* Extreme rainfall has already jumped 9 percent compared with the first half of the 20th century and is projected to go up another 20 percent by the end of the 21st century if carbon pollution continues unabated. If carbon pollution is somewhat reduced it would only increase 11 percent.\n* An extremely wet spring in 2013 and a March 2012 heat wave were found to be connected to man-made climate change.\nCredit: Associated Press\nCaption: FILE - In this Sept. 23, 2014, file photo, vehicles negotiate heavily flooded streets as rain falls in Miami Beach, Fla.

In its most recent report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that it is "extremely likely" that, since the 1950s, humans and their greenhouse gas emissions have been the "dominant cause" of the planet\'s warming trend.\nBut that conclusion, shared by the vast majority of experts in the United States and around the world, has done little to stop Pruitt, Perry and other administration officials from raising doubts.\nThe idea of a "red team-blue team" exercise stems in part from a Wall Street Journal commentary by New York University professor Steven Koonin.\nKelly Levin, a senior associate with the World Resources Institute\'s major emerging economies objective, wrote in a blog post last month that the kind of adversarial process Pruitt is advocating is better suited for policy debates than for scientific findings.\n"Scientific understanding, unlike proposals for what to do about a given problem, is well established through the scientific method," wrote Levin, noting that 97 per cent of peer-reviewed papers on climate change support the idea that humans play a contributing factor. "If skeptics want their voices heard in scientific discourse, they should try to get their findings published in the peer-reviewed literature. They would then be assessed on their merits through peer review."\nSome members of EPA\'s scientific rank-and-file, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, questioned Pruitt\'s plan.\n"It\'s an obvious attempt to cast doubt on climate science under the guise of a common sense-sounding process," said one EPA employee who focuses on climate issues. "But of course, we already have a process for scrutiny of the science - the peer review process is a much more robust assessment of scientific integrity than a childish colour war."\nThe employee called the effort "incredibly insulting".\nThe efforts to question the existing science on climate change have raised questions both within the government and among industry officials about whether Pruitt intends to try to roll back the EPA\'s 2009 "endangerment finding", which determined that greenhouse gases posed a risk to public health and created the basis for Obama-era regulations on emissions from power plants, automobiles and other sources.\nTwo people with knowledge of the red team-blue team undertaking - one inside the Trump administration and one lobbyist - said its purpose was not explicitly to help target the agency\'s 2009 finding that emissions of greenhouse gases linked to climate change constitute pollutants under the Clean Air Act, though that idea is still under discussion among administration officials\nUS President Donald Trump questioned the link between human activity multiple times during the 2016 campaign, though he has not addressed the issue directly since his inauguration. In his most recent remarks, in an interview with Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace in December, Trump said that "nobody really knows" if climate change is real.\nAfter the President announced a month ago that the US would be withdrawing from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, multiple reporters have asked White House officials to clarify the President\'s views on climate science. But they have declined to do so.\nPruitt\'s EPA also took down an agency website in late April that was focused on climate change, and highlighted the scientific consensus that it is caused by humans.\n\nWashington Post \n 2017 Yerepouni Daily News.

Wayan Superman said. They drove to a resort in Ubud, an arts and culture center amid hills and rice paddies where they will spend most of their vacation on Bali.\nHe said they were accompanied by Obama\'s half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng, and would also visit Yogyakarta, an ancient city on the main island of Java where his mother, Ann Dunham, did anthropological research.\nObama moved to Indonesia in 1967 at age 6 after his divorced mother married an Indonesian man. She stayed on after the marriage broke up, working as an anthropologist and development aid worker. But 10-year-old Obama returned to Hawaii to live with his grandparents.\nForeign ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir said Indonesian President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo had invited Obama to take a holiday in the country .\nSchwarzenegger talks climate change with French president * Former California Gov.

"They are the most at risk."\nSeveral outside marine and climate scientists praised the work, saying it showed the importance of protecting these areas and reducing fishing.\n"Biodiversity and fisheries are humanity\'s legacy" that should be preserved, marine ecologist Maria Vernet of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography said in an email. She wasn\'t part of the research.\nWhile scientists in the past have identified key areas of biodiversity, the new work is more detailed. Researchers found the liveliest ocean hot spot also happens to be where the science of evolution sprouted: the Pacific Ocean off the central South American coast. It includes the area around the Galapagos Islands and goes back to "our good friend [Charles] Darwin. When he went there, he got amazed," Chiaradia said.\nOther hot spots include the southwestern Atlantic Ocean off Argentina; the western Indian Ocean off the African coast; the central western Pacific Ocean surrounding Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines; the southwestern Pacific off Australia\'s southern and eastern coast; and the Oceania region of the Pacific around the international date line.\nFour of the six hot spots are in the Pacific; all are either in the southern hemisphere or just north of the equator.\nKEY ISOLATION\n"What makes this biodiversity? It\'s the isolation," Chiaradia said. "On land, we have kangaroos and weird animals like the platypus. And in the ocean it\'s not different."\nThe ocean is home to Australian sea dragons, a fish related to the seahorse that resemble mythical dragons and sometimes even have yellow and purple markings on their bodies.\nThese hot spots also tend to be places where the ocean waters churn more, Chiaradia said.\nPenguins, which are near the top of the food chain, are a good example of the impact of changing water temperatures and currents. Warm El Nio waters have decimated Galapagos penguins, and the population of southern African penguins has dropped by about 90 percent in just 20 years, Chiaradia said.\nCredit: SETH BORENSTEIN; Associated Press\nCaption: FILE - In this Aug. 27, 2015 file photo, a Penguin runs out of the ocean after swimming with other penguins at Boulders beach a popular tourist destination in Simon\'s Town, South Africa.

Its better to look at what the climate scientists have to say.\nEvery scientific body of national/international standing concurs that anthropogenic global warming is an existential threat. NASA has a list of all 230 of them; so does every publishing climate scientist worldwide, over 69,000 of them (National Physical Sciences Consortium).\nWe need to tax fossil fuel corporations out of existence and give all that tax money to the taxpayers in equal monthly checks. British Columbias done that for eight years and they have the lowest emissions in North American and the best economy (The Economist).\nTheyve used carbon fee-and-dividend: Fossil fuels pay the fee, we get the dividends in equal monthly checks. The fee increases annually; so do your dividends.\nSwitch to solar/wind and you dont pay the fee, but you still get the dividends. Youll save more every year as theyre now as cheap or cheaper than any fossil fuel (Fortune) and theyll continue to drop in price as they scale up (Bloomberg). This will create millions of jobs and increase GDP $75 billion-$80 billion annually (CitizensClimateLobby.org).\n\nLynn Goldfarb,\n\n\nDenver, Colorado \n\n'b'PARIS * President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron set aside lingering differences on climate change during their meeting in France on Thursday, asserting that it shouldn\'t prevent them from working together toward a postwar road map for Syria and to enhance Mideast security.\nTrump, standing alongside Macron at a news conference, said the two nations had "occasional disagreements" but that that would not disrupt a friendship that dates back to the American Revolution. He remained noncommittal about the United States\' eventually rejoining the global climate agreement that bears Paris\' name, telling Macron, "If it happens that will be wonderful, and if it doesn\'t, that will be OK too."\nMacron acknowledged sharp differences on the Paris climate pact but said the two leaders could find other areas of cooperation. "Should that have an impact on the discussions we\'re having on all other topics? No, absolutely not," he said.\nTrump arrived in the French capital on Thursday for a whirlwind, 36-hour visit to meet with Macron and tackle potential solutions to the crisis in Syria and discuss broader counterterrorism strategies before being feted at Bastille Day celebrations Friday.\nThe president landed in Paris amid questions about emails showing that his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., welcomed the prospect of receiving Russian government support in last year\'s presidential campaign between his father and Hillary Clinton.\nTrump defended his namesake, saying that "most people would have taken that meeting," a message that contradicted his incoming FBI director\'s testimony that Donald Trump Jr. should have instead alerted authorities.\nSYRIA, TERRORISM\nTopics such as resolving the years-long civil war in Syria and countering terrorism gave Trump and Macron areas to cooperate. The two said they also discussed the security situations in Ukraine and Libya.\nTrump praised a cease-fire in southern Syria that he helped broker last week with Russia and Jordan and said the U.S. was working on a second cease-fire in a "rough part of Syria."\nMacron said he discussed with Trump a road map for the country that would help stabilize the situation after the war ends. He has argued for intervention in Syria, saying that President Bashar Assad is a threat to the war-ravaged country and the Islamic State group is a threat to France.\nFrance has been plagued in recent years by extremist attacks, and Trump noted that during last year\'s Bastille Day celebrations, a 19-ton cargo truck deliberately plowed into crowds in Nice, killing more than 80 people.\nWhile the U.S. has split with the major world powers on the environment, the two leaders tried to patch over those differences.\nTrump has said the climate deal was unfair to the U.S. but said the country was committed to protecting the environment despite his recent decision to withdraw.\nMacron, a staunch advocate of research to combat global warming, has beckoned "all responsible citizens," including American scientists and researchers, to bring their fight against climate change to France.\nTrump, Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other world leaders huddled last week in Hamburg, Germany, during a summit of the world\'s leading rich and developing nations. Merkel and Macron met again Thursday in Paris, before Macron\'s meeting with Trump. Trump and Merkel were not expected to meet.\nMerkel said during a joint appearance with Macron that it was important they keep talking with Trump even where the differences between them are clear.\n"We did not paper over these differences, but nevertheless contact, the ability to speak, is of course important," she said.\nTrump and Macron spent several hours together Thursday in some of Paris\' most opulent settings, with a visit to the golden-domed Invalides monument followed by meetings at the presidential palace. Trump also marked the 100th anniversary of America\'s entry into World War I by visiting U.S. troops.\nThe visit, along with the celebration of French national pride on Bastille Day, was cast by the White House as a commemoration of the U.S.-French military alliance - then and now.\nThe leaders and their wives capped Thursday with a lavish dinner at the Jules Verne restaurant in the Eiffel Tower.\nIt put Trump in the awkward position of being feted in a city he has repeatedly disparaged. When he announced his decision on the climate agreement, Trump said he was "elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris." And he has frequently said in the past that the city has been ruined by the threat of terrorism, which he ties to immigrants.\n"Paris isn\'t Paris any longer," he said in February.\nAsked about those comments, Trump called Paris "one of the great cities, one of the most beautiful cities in the world" and heaped praise on the recently elected Macron, telling reporters, "You have a great leader now, you have a great president."\n"You\'re going to have a very, very peaceful and beautiful Paris, and I\'m coming back," Trump said, needling Macron, "You better do a good job, please. Otherwise you\'re going to make me look very bad."\nMacron responded, "You\'re always welcome."\nMORE ON TRUMP JR.\nTrump characterized his son\'s meeting with a Russian lawyer during the presidential contest as standard campaign practice and maintained that "nothing happened" as a result of the sit-down in June 2016.\n"I think from a practical standpoint most people would\'ve taken that meeting. It\'s called opposition research," Trump said.\nTrump\'s support for the encounter stood in contrast to the position of his nominee for FBI director, Christopher Wray, who at his confirmation hearing on Wednesday was asked what candidates should do if they\'re told a foreign government wanted to help by offering damaging information about an opponent.\n"Any threat or effort to interfere with our elections from any nation-state or any nonstate actor," Wray said, "is the kind of thing the FBI would want to know."\nTrump Jr. himself said in a Fox News interview on Tuesday night that "in retrospect I probably would have done things a little differently."\nMeanwhile, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said Thursday that he would call on Trump Jr. to testify as part of investigations into Russian meddling in last year\'s election and would subpoena him if necessary.\nSen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said he wanted Trump Jr. to testify "pretty soon" - as early as next week. \nSESSIONS\' SECURITY\nAlso Thursday, the Justice Department released a heavily redacted page from Attorney General Jeff Sessions\' security clearance application in response to a government watchdog group\'s lawsuit.\nThe application page asks whether Sessions  a senator before joining the Trump administration  or anyone in his immediate family had contact within the past seven years with a foreign government or its representatives. There\'s a "no" box checked, but the rest of the answer is blacked out.\nThe department had already acknowledged that Sessions omitted from his form meetings he had with foreign dignitaries, including the Russian ambassador. A department spokesman said the FBI agent who helped with the form said those encounters didn\'t have to be included, as routine contacts were part of Sessions\' Senate duties.\nCredit: VIVIAN SALAMA; Associated Press\nCaption: French President Emmanuel Macron, left, smiles while U.S President Donald Trump waves while leaving Les Invalides museum in Paris, Thursday, July 13 2017 as part of Trump\'s visit to France for Bastille Day celebrations in Paris.

(AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)\n'b'\nTech CEOs have been among the most vocal critics of President Donald Trump\'s decision to exit the Paris Climate Agreement, but a group of former Republican leaders also resisted the move. Today they unveiled their own climate change plan, a free market approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. \n\nThe Climate Leadership Council has been working since February on a "conservative climate solution" to fight global warming by taxing greenhouse gas emissions and returning the money to taxpayers as a "climate dividend." The average family of four would receive $2,000 a year under the plan. \n\nWhile the CLC is led by three men who served under Republican presidents--former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, along with former Secretaries of State James Baker and George Shultz--the group\'s 14 founding members come from all sides of the political spectrum. They include former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, physicist Stephen Hawking, economist Lawrence Summers and philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs (Steve Jobs\' widow). \n\nMost crucially, however, the council\'s 11 corporate partners include oil companies--including BP, ExxonMobil and Shell--along with environmental groups such as The Nature Conservancy and corporations like General Motors, Johnson & Johnson and Unilever. \n\n"We acknowledged long ago that climate change is real and that lowering emissions is both a social imperative and an economic opportunity," GM said in a statement. "Addressing climate change in an effective and sustainable manner requires a holistic approach involving all sectors of the economy." \n\nThe CLC laid out its vision in a full-page ad in today\'s Wall Street Journal. Aside from the carbon tax and dividends, the group also supports rolling back carbon regulations that are no longer necessary. It also advocates border carbon adjustments, which would increase the cost of goods coming from nations that don\'t have a carbon tax. \n\n"Our carbon dividends solution is: Pro-Environment, Pro-Growth, Pro-Jobs, Pro-Competitiveness, Pro-Business and Pro-National Security," the ad reads. "Working with a range of constituencies, the Climate Leadership Council will develop and promote a consensus climate solution based on these pillars." \n\nThe plan sets an initial tax of $40 per ton of carbon dioxide produced, which would add 36 cents to the cost of each gallon of gas--the rate would rise over time as demand for fossil fuels presumably went down. The group estimates the tax would raise more than $225 billion a year. \n\nA CLC analysis predicted that this plan would meet the climate goals set by President Barack Obama twice as quickly as his own policies would have. \n\nNot everyone is a fan of the proposal, however. One sentence of the CLC manifesto in particular caught Greenpeace\'s attention: "Robust carbon taxes would also make possible an end to federal and state tort liability for emitters." In other words, fossil fuel companies wouldn\'t face any legal consequences for exacerbating the effects of climate change. \n\n"Across the globe, communities, shareholders and top law enforcement agencies are launching investigations and litigation against fossil fuel companies," Greenpeace said in a statement. "A nicely worded public relations exercise is no cure for decades of deception." \n\nWhile members of the CLC met in February with Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, the White House has not officially commented on the full proposal. \n\nCredit: John Bonazzo \n'b'Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., issued the following news release:\nIn an interview today on CNBC\'s Squawk Box, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry denied that CO2 emissions are primarily responsible for climate change, stating instead that "the primary control knob is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in." In response, Congressman Earl Blumenauer (OR-03) today sent a letter to Perry with educational materials outlining the basic established science behind climate change.\nBlumenauer and 32 of his colleagues sent the same materials to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt in March following Pruitt\'s similar comments on CO2 emissions.\n"This is a disturbing case of dejr vu, as two of the administration\'s top energy and environment \'leaders\' continue to ignore basic climate science," said Blumenauer. "Their assertions are wrong and go against conclusions drawn by NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and 97 percent of climate scientists. Their jobs demand at least a basic understanding of established science, and the American people demand climate action."\nThe full text of Blumenauer\'s letter to Secretary Perry is below:\nDear Secretary Perry:\nPlease find enclosed a copy of materials 32 of my colleagues and I sent to EPA Administrator Pruitt after he claimed on CNBC\'s Squawk Box that carbon dioxide is not a primary contributor to climate change.

This guide was developed by current climate scientists, formal and informal educators, and representatives of a range of U.S. agencies in order to explain a number of important concepts behind climate change. In addition, the letter included a copy of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\'s Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis report, and the highlights from the latest U.S. National Climate Assessment.\nMSTRUCK-5920516 MSTRUCK\n'b'Beth Taylor Wilsons guest column, titled No excuse for ignorance (June 2), is a gem. It deserves to be read by everyone. Wilson speaks out forcefully against the foolishness of denying climate change. She advocates instead standing up for science, and for real facts and scientific truths.\nHere is what people need to know about science. Science is a strategy for understanding the universe in which we live. Science has one unique trick: evidence. A good scientist is humble, which is to say that he or she must be willing to subordinate his or her beliefs, hypotheses, prejudices, etc., to evidence. Climate scientists accept the reality of global warming and human contribution to global warming, not because these conclusions are pleasing but because the evidence is compelling.\nSo what does it mean when a citizen (or politician) does not believe in global warming? Does it mean that the citizen has scrutinized the extensive and highly technical scientific evidence, and found fatal methodological flaws? Or does it mean that the citizen chooses to remain ignorant of the evidence because he or she fears the truth? Sometimes it apparently means only that there was a recent cold spell in someones village.\n\nMerrill Hiscock,\n\n\nLolo\n\n'b'HARTFORD - Nobel laureate Gary Yohe, who shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for his groundbreaking research on climate change, joined Gov. Dannel P. Malloy to speak out Wednesday against major cuts to environmental programs proposed by President Donald Trump.\nYohe, a longtime professor at Wesleyan University in Middletown, said he has been conducting climate research since 1982 - long before it was on the public radar screen.\n"As a scholar with more than three decades of experience studying climate change, I fear our new president is on a course to reverse this progress with extremely dangerous consequences,\'\' Yohe said.\nYohe worked as a senior member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which shared the Nobel prize with former Vice President Al Gore.\nMalloy, Yohe and others gathered on the top floor of the Connecticut Science Center Wednesday to blast the proposed cuts of about $2.6 billion in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\'s $8.3 billion budget. The cuts would eliminate about 3,200 federal jobs from an agency that now has 15,000 positions.\nThe setting was appropriate, said Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Commissioner Robert Klee, because "science itself is under attack in the federal budget.\'\'\nWith mounting opposition from environmental groups and Democrats in Congress, Malloy predicted that Trump\'s original proposal will be changed before the federal fiscal year starts on October 1.\n"I don\'t think the department will see a 31 percent cut in its budget when everything is said and done,\'\' Malloy said told reporters.\nThe problems with air and water pollution accumulate over time and can have long-lasting impacts, officials said.\n"This is absolutely an attack on future generations - those yet unborn who will suffer the consequences,\'\' Malloy said. "We will remain diligent, at least while the commissioner and I are around, but we won\'t apparently have that strong federal partnership\'\' in the future.\nFunding for climate science is also facing cuts at the Department of Energy, NASA, the State Department and the Department of Commerce,Yohe said. He said that gains had been made during the administration of President Barack Obama, where Yohe worked in an unpaid position as the vice chairman of the Third National Climate Assessment.\n"By way of stark contrast, President Trump does not even have a science adviser,\'\' Yohe said. "His administration has attacked climate science, and it has announced its intention to abandon any initiative designed to ameliorate climate risk in any way.\'\'\nSome Trump supporters have questioned climate change, including Scott Pruitt, the top U.S. environmental official.\n"I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there\'s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, so no, I would not agree that it\'s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see," Pruitt said in a television interview two weeks ago. "But we don\'t know that yet. We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis."\nBut Yohe, who studied under economist William D. Nordhaus at Yale University, said Wednesday that there is no debate about the science.\n"I am convinced that it is irresponsible and immoral for the elected and appointed leaders of our country to dismiss the science that has produced undeniable evidence describing those risks and their human sources - evidence from observations of climate that have already occurred across the country and around the world and from what we have robustly projected for the future,\'\' Yohe said.\nHe added that environmental groups would probably file lawsuits to block various actions on the environment.\n"Mr. Trump might be facing a lot of time in court,\'\' Yohe told The Courant.\nIn releasing the budget, the Trump administration said that the spending plan "reflects the success of environmental protection efforts, a focus on core legal requirements, the important role of the states in implementing the nation\'s environmental laws, and the president\'s priority to ease the burden of unnecessary federal regulations that impose significant costs for workers and consumers without justifiable environmental benefits."\nCredit: ckeating@courant.com -  -  - ; By CHRISTOPHER KEATING\n'b'Last month, a group of former Republican Party heavyweights  conservatives to their cores  unveiled a sensible plan to address climate change through a refundable tax on carbon. The plan landed in official Washington with a barely audible thud.\nThe version of the Republican Party that today runs the White House and Congress is different from the fact-based party that embraced the likes of James A. Baker III, George P. Shultz, Martin Feldstein and Henry Paulson during the Nixon, Ford, Reagan and both Bush administrations. Such pragmatists would not be welcome in President Donald Trump\'s administration.\nTheir Climate Leadership Council acknowledges two realities that are heresies to Trump and most Republicans in Congress: Man-made climate change is a real and growing threat, and tax policy is the best way to address it. Baker and company are willing to bash the Obama Administration\'s climate policies but not without offering what they think are better and workable alternatives. Government by pragmatists, in other words.\nA carbon tax is not a new idea. It is grounded in conservative advocacy for consumption taxes instead of taxes on wealth and aversion to business regulation, such as President Barack Obama\'s Clean Power Plan. Such a tax allows predictability for business and promotes economic growth.\nA $40-a-ton carbon tax, levied on producers, would be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. The Climate Leadership Council plan would raise between $200 billion and $300 billion a year and be rebated to offset the cost of the tax; a household of four would get a $2,000 "carbon dividend."\nA better proposal would be to use the carbon tax to replace Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes. The increased revenue would shore up both programs indefinitely. But the point is largely academic, because any carbon tax proposal is a long shot at best.\nCurrently, societal costs of burning fossil fuels  mostly a warming planet  go largely unpaid. Some climate experts have estimated that an $80-a-ton carbon tax might be enough to forestall the worst effects of climate change. But it would wreak havoc on the coal industry, and Trump said recently, "We\'re going to put our miners back to work" to produce "beautiful clean-coal energy."\nIf only such a thing as "clean coal" existed. Coal\'s emissions can be sequestered underground, but large-scale sequestration is technically difficult and prohibitively costly.\nThe old-school Republicans at the Climate Leadership Council are hoping for better. They wrote in a New York Times op-ed, "Republicans are in charge of both Congress and the White House. If they do nothing other than reverse regulations from the Obama administration, they will squander the opportunity to show the full power of the conservative canon, and its core principles of free markets, limited government and stewardship."\nCredit: By the Editorial Board\nCaption: A coal-fired power plant in Kansas.

The conference will focus on ideas and solutions to create effective and sustainable changes to improve mountain livelihoods.\nSpeaking at the inauguration session, Minister for Population and Environment Mithila Chaudhary expressed her hope that the outcomes of conference would contribute to improve the socio-economic conditions of the people living in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan region.\nSimilarly, Secretary at the ministry Prakash Mathema said the adverse impacts of climate change and other drivers of change posed serious threats to development efforts, so urgent actions were required from all to build resilience of people and ecosystems.\nDuring the conference, participant groups will discuss ideas for strengthening the fragile environments and communities of the Hindu Kush Himalaya, a mountain range that spans from Afghanistan to Myanmar.\nThe HKH sources 10 major river systems in Asia that provide water, ecosystem services, and livelihoods to more than 210 million people. The region holds and distributes water for more than 1.3 billion people living in downstream river basins.\nClimate change and other drivers of change in the HKH have already begun to impact ecosystems and communities increasing vulnerability and exposure to natural disasters such as floods, droughts and landslides.\nResilience is the ability of communities and ecosystems to be prepared for shocks, recover from shocks and "bounce forward" to emerge stronger than before. ICIMOD and its partners have been working on developing solutions for resilience building, promoting regional cooperation and enhancing knowledge for sustainable mountain development.\nFor an effective response to the complex challenges facing the HKH, multiple actors need to come together and share knowledge, and develop collective vision for the region.\nCopyright 2017 Asia Pacific Communication Associates Nepal Pvt Ltd, distributed by Contify.com\nCredit: Himalayan news service\n'b'SACRAMENTO, Calif. * Gov. Jerry Brown\'s aggressive plea for lawmakers to renew California\'s signature climate change law proved fruitful last week, bolstering his credibility as a world leader in the fight against global warming.\nIt also again showcased the Democrat\'s political skill in Sacramento, where just months earlier he helped convince the largely Democratic Legislature to raise gas prices to pay for road and bridge projects.\nNext up: Fulfilling a pledge to tackle California\'s affordable housing crisis when lawmakers head back to the Capitol in August. After that, he will keep promoting an ambitious slate of climate policies in the state and beyond, and work at home to secure the future of lofty efforts to build a bullet train and re-engineer the state\'s water system.\nBrown, 79, pursues projects that will exist long after he leaves the governor\'s office but resists the word "legacy" at every opportunity. Longtime observers say his win on the cap-and-trade program to reduce carbon emissions, and how he spends the last 17 months of his final term, will inevitably shape how he\'s remembered. Brown previously served two terms as governor, ending in the early 1980s.\n"Without question, it\'s a victory for him on several levels," Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a professor of public policy communication at the University of Southern California, said of the deal on cap and trade, which puts a limit on carbon emissions and requires polluters to obtain permits to release greenhouse gases. "He denied that this was about his legacy, but it was."\nBeyond California, Brown is a special adviser for a U.N. climate conference in Germany this November. He\'s also planning a global climate conference in San Francisco next year and leading an alliance among states, cities, businesses and others to help the United States meet the goals of the global Paris climate agreement after President Donald Trump pulled out.\n"There is a lot of work to be done in California, but there\'s a lot of persuasion and encouragement needed throughout the whole world," Brown told The Associated Press in a phone interview Wednesday.\nTo help win a climate deal, the governor pledged to work with lawmakers on an affordable housing agreement before the year\'s end. Rent prices in the state have risen faster than incomes, and roughly 1.5 million homes are lacking for low-income renters.\nFixing the crisis has proved a near intractable issue in the Capitol, with lawmakers rejecting a housing plan that Brown put forward last year.\nThe governor has long argued for streamlining regulations that can stifle construction before providing more money for building projects. But now he has agreed to pursue long-term funding as part of a deal, a commitment that may have secured additional Democratic votes on cap and trade.\n"There\'s no magic wand for housing prices," Brown said. "That is not an easily solved matter."\nAs Brown\'s tenure wraps up, two of his signature, but troubled, infrastructure projects are looming large: construction of a high-speed rail system between Los Angeles and San Francisco and two giant tunnels to carry northern California water to the south.\nBrown has aggressively pushed for the bullet train since taking office for the second time in 2010, despite critics complaining about its high cost to taxpayers and whether it\'s even necessary. Its price estimates have skyrocketed from $40 billion to $64 billion, and future funding is not certain.\nA chunk of money for rail that comes in from cap and trade could be renegotiated in 2024 due to a constitutional amendment passed by lawmakers this week. If voters approve it, lawmakers will get a clean slate on determining how that money is spent.\nDan Richard, chairman of the California High Speed Rail Board, acknowledges the difficulties of getting lawmakers to spend money on a project that won\'t provide immediate results. Construction is underway for a segment connecting San Jose to Bakersfield, scheduled to be operational in 2025.\n"We\'re talking about committing public dollars right now to something that does not have immediate benefits," Richard said. But, he added, "in seven years I\'m less concerned about being able to make the argument."\nMeanwhile, the $16 billion project to reroute California\'s water from north to south through two giant tunnels is awaiting key federal and state approvals after winning early support in from federal wildlife officials.\nThe state also is battling with water agencies over who will pay for what parts of the project. But Brown expressed confidence the project will move forward  and that his successor will see its benefits.\n"This project is teed up in a way that it never has been before, and it will proceed within the next 15 or 16 months," he said. "So I think the next governor, whether they\'d like to talk about it or not, I think there will be a strong inclination to stay the course."\nCredit: KATHLEEN RONAYNE; Associated Press\nCaption: FILE -- In this May 28, 2015 file photo California Gov.

What else lays waste to such a wide swath of the Montana way of life as global warming?\nAgriculture, tourism, fly-fishing, hunting, and skiing are all being degraded by fossil fueled climate change. Ask fishing guides leaning against drift boats in their driveways during river closures if human-caused climate change is real.\nThe climate havoc unfolding in Montana is part of a global conflagration that is already killing many hundreds of children per day, mostly in developing countries. Our own children may meet the same fate if we dont address the climate crisis at the scale and speed it requires. It is that serious.\nSo the question remains, what are we going to do about human caused climate change?\nAll Humanity, All In\nThe simple truth is that to save our gravely threatened environment and our childrens only home, we will have to stabilize the inflamed global atmosphere; we will have to save the world. And that means we need to address the climate threat in concert with other nations.\nThat is what the Paris Climate Agreement is all about.\nCarbon dioxide emitted today from a car in Great Falls, a factory in India or a family home in Tokyo promptly mixes with the global atmosphere where it starts trapping heat. It is the epitome of a global threat.\nThe Paris Climate Accord was a stunning diplomatic achievement. Imagine getting 197 countries to agree on something as consequential as transforming their entire energy systems.\nFor the first time every country on earth, save Nicaragua and Syria, signed an agreement to reduce their emissions. Each nation was required to come up with an emissions reduction plan.\nTop oil producer Russia signed. China and India signed. Saudi Arabia, Iran and every other member country of OPEC signed. Canada and Mexico signed. And the participation of the United States was essential to sealing the deal.\nUnified global action is critical for extricating Montana and the rest of the planet from the grips of the climate crisis.\nIt is imperative that global fossil fuel emissions reductions are executed at the scale and speed appropriate to the climate emergency. The initial Paris emissions pledges are not ambitious enough. However, a structure for strengthening those targets is now in place because everyone bellied up to the climate table in Paris.\nBy pulling the worlds largest historic carbon polluter out of the Paris agreement President Trump increases Montanas climate peril and that of our children.\nThe Surpassing Moral Issue of our Time\nOur values are our judgment of what is important in life. What could be more important than joining with the rest of humanity to preserve the only home our children will ever have? What could be more important than preserving our cherished Montana environment and the economy which depends on its health and vitality?\nThe burning of coal, oil and natural gas causes climate change. Therefore we have to move to a 100% renewable energy system as fast as possible. The United States should be leading the international effort to address climate change, not impeding it.\n\n***\n\n\nDavid Merrill, Senior Organizing Representative, Sierra Club\n\n\nSenator Tom Facey, Montana Legislature\n\n\nGail Gutsche, former member, Montana Public Service Commission\n\n\nJeff Smith, co-chair, 350 Montana\n\n'b'New Zealand will be represented in an international team appointed by the United Nations to investigate the impacts of global warming of 1.5 Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\nCanterbury University Associate Professor Bronwyn Hayward will be among 86 experts from 39 countries who will prepare a special report for the UN\'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\nThe report is due to be published next year and follows the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat climate change.\nIt will look at ways to arrest global warming levels by assessing research and highlighting policy options.\nAssoc Prof Hayward is head of Canterbury University\'s Department of Political Science and International Relations.\n"We need interdisciplinary thinking to address complex serious problems," she said.\n"It is heartening to see recognition for the way arts and humanities can also assist us in tackling some of our world\'s greatest challenges."\nThe Paris Agreement aims to keep the global temperature rise this century well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the increase further to 1.5C.\nNew Zealand ratified the agreement last October.\nCredit: NZN\n'b'Alternative facts have no place in climate-change research. Greater integrity is essential if the scandals are to stop. Matt Ridley reports. \nBack in December, some American scientists began copying government climate data on to independent servers in what press reports described as an attempt to safeguard it from political interference by the Trump administration. \nThere is to be a March for Science in April whose organisers say: "It is time for people who support scientific research and evidence-based policies to take a public stand and be counted." \nWell, today they have a chance to do just that, but against their own colleagues who stand accused of doing what they claim the Trump team has done. Devastating new testimony from Dr John Bates, a whistleblowing senior scientist at America\'s main climate agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, alleges that scientists themselves have been indulging in alternative facts, fake news and policy-based evidence. \nBates\'s essay on the Climate Etc. website documents allegations of scientific misconduct as serious as that of the anti-vaccine campaign of Andrew Wakefield. \nBates\'s boss, Tom Karl, a close ally of President Obama\'s science adviser, John Holdren, published a paper in 2015, deliberately timed to influence the Paris climate jamboree. The paper was widely hailed in the media as disproving the politically inconvenient 18-year pause in global warming, whose existence had been conceded by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) two years earlier. \nBates says Karl based the "pausebuster" paper on a flawed land-surface data set that had not been verified or properly archived; and on a sea-surface set that corrected reliable data from buoys with unreliable data from ship intakes, which resulted in a slightly enhanced warming trend. \nScience magazine is considering retracting the paper. A key congressional committee says the allegations confirm some of its suspicions. Bates is no "denier"; he was awarded a gold medal by the US government in 2014 for his climate-data work. \nHaving now retired, he writes of "flagrant manipulation of scientific integrity guidelines and scientific publication standards", of a "rush to time the publication of the paper to influence national and international deliberations on climate policy" and concludes: "So, in every aspect of the preparation and release of the data sets leading into [the report], we find Tom Karl\'s thumb on the scale pushing for, and often insisting on, decisions that maximize warming and minimize documentation." \nThis is more than just a routine scientific scandal. \nFirst, it comes as scientists have been accusing President Trump and other politicians of politicising science \nSecond, it potentially contaminates any claim that climate science has been producing unbiased results. \nThird, it embarrasses science journalists who have been chronicling the growing evidence of scientific misconduct in medicine, toxicology and psychology, but ignored the same about climate science because they approve of the cause, a habit known as noble-cause corruption. \nColleagues of Karl have been quick to dismiss the story, saying that other data sets come to similar conclusions. This is to miss the point and exacerbate the problem. If the scientific establishment reacts to allegations of lack of transparency, behind-closed-door adjustments and premature release so as to influence politicians, by saying it does not matter because it gets the "right" result, they will find it harder to convince Trump that he is wrong on things such as vaccines. \nBesides, this is just the latest scandal to rock climate science. The biggest was climategate in 2009, which showed scientists conspiring to ostracise sceptics, delete emails, game peer review and manipulate the presentation of data, including the truncation of a tree-ring-derived graph to disguise the fact that it seemed to show recent cooling ("hide the decline"). The scientists concerned were criticised by two rather perfunctory inquiries, but have since taken to saying they were "exonerated". \nThere was the case of the paper the IPCC relied upon to show that local urban warming was not distorting global data sets, which turned out to be based partly on non-existent data from 49 Chinese weather stations; the Scandinavian lake sediment core used "upside down" to imply sudden warming; the chart showing unprecedented recent warming that turned out to depend on a single larch tree in Siberia; the southern hemisphere hockey- stick chart that had been created by the omission of inconvenient data series; the Antarctic temperature trend that turned out to depend on splicing together two weather station records. \nThen there was the time when a well known climate scientist, Peter Gleick, stole the identity of a member of a think tank so he could leak confidential documents along with a fake one. Stephan Lewandowsky had to retract a paper about the psychology of climate scepticism that seemed to be full of methodological flaws and bizarre reasoning. \nAnd don\'t forget Dr Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of the IPCC for 13 years and often described as the "world\'s top climate scientist". He had to retract his "voodoo science" dismissal of a valid finding that contradicted claims from Pachauri\'s own research institute about Himalayan glaciers, which had led to a lucrative grant. \nThat scandal resulted in a highly critical report into the IPCC by several of the world\'s top science academies, which recommended among other things that the IPCC chairman stand down after one term. Pachauri ignored this, kept his job and toured the world while urging others not to, before resigning over a personal scandal allegation. \nI have championed science all my adult life. It is humankind\'s greatest calling. That is why I deplore those who drag down its reputation by breaching its codes of conduct for political reasons, and I have no time for those excusing these enormities. They foment anti-intellectualism and play directly into the hands of people such as Trump. \n"Under the Obama administration," says Professor Judith Curry, Bates\'s colleague, "I suspect that it would have been very difficult for this story to get any traction." Yikes. Bates calls for more ethics teaching in science and for "respectful discussion of different points of view" - which we were emptily promised after climategate. \nIt is time for the many brilliant scientists who are discovering great insights into quasars and quarks, Alzheimer\'s and allergies, into neurons, fossils, telomeres and ice ages, to "take a public stand and be counted" against the politicisation of some science within their own ranks. \n- The Times\n'b'A landmark pledge seven years ago by the worlds richest nations to spend billions to help developing countries tackle climate change seemed like a godsend for Kiribati, the Pacific island nation threatened by rising seas.\nThe result of that promise was the Green Climate Fund. But Kiribati  like many of the poorest countries most vulnerable to climate change  has yet to see any project funding.\nInstead, many of the projects that have won early backing were approved despite concerns raised by current and former observers on the funds board over whether officials had done due diligence on projects  especially on those involving the private sector, which make up half of the approximately $2.6 billion in project financing authorized so far.\nWe raised our objections, but the gavel just came down, said Liane Schalatek, one of two civil society observers on the funds board and associate director at the Heinrich Bll Foundation North America, an environmental group associated with the Greens party in Germany.\nTheres a real lack of transparency, she said.\nThe observers took issue, for example, with a proposed project that would hand out $265 million in equity and grants to Geeref Next, a Luxembourg-based investment fund that proposed to finance renewable energy or energy efficiency projects in about 30 countries  with no explicit plan to disclose what those projects would be.\nThe funds 24-member board approved the proposal.\nThe board observers have also asked why the funds finances, set up to back locally owned projects that reach the most vulnerable communities, were going toward private-sector enterprises led by global investment firms  like $110 million in loans and grants for solar projects in Kazakhstan led by London-based United Green Energy and the investment arm of Kazakhstans sovereign wealth fund.\nThose concerns also went unaddressed.\nAccording to funding proposals for the 54 projects approved so far, as well as a record of objections raised by board observers, other projects that have raised red flags include:\n $25 million in equity and grants administered from Mauritius, a corporate tax haven, for off-grid solar power in Rwanda, Kenya and Uganda;\n $50 million in loans and grants to repair a Soviet-era dam in Tajikistan, even though experts have warned that hydropower there is vulnerable to the retreat of the snow melt that feeds dams;\n $9 million in loans to a renewable energy project in rural Mongolia that observers worried would be used to power coal mining.\nThe Green Climate Fund also faces challenges on the donor front.\nThis year, President Trump said the United States would no longer pay into the fund  a snub that accompanied the Trump administrations decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\nThe United States had promised to contribute $3 billion  more than any other country, though less than other donors on a per-capita basis  of which the Obama administration delivered $1 billion.\nIndustrialized nations have indeed pledged to generate $100 billion a year by 2020 to help developing countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and address the effects of climate change. The fund has so far secured $10.3 billion in financing.\nTo be sure, the climate fund has also enjoyed some notable successes, including private projects. The off-grid solar projects in Rwanda and Kenya, for example, have been praised for their focus on reaching remote communities.\nBut the board observers concerns underscore the challenges facing the fund, now a pillar of the Paris climate pact, as negotiators gather this week at United Nations climate talks in Bonn, Germany.\nCritically, the early mix of approvals has meant that less than a tenth of the funding has gone to the kind of projects that make up the funds mandate: those owned and controlled by the poorer nations themselves.\nTheres little enough, as it is, of public funds for climate, and so much of it is going toward sweetening returns for the private sector, said Lidy Nacpil, coordinator of the Asian Peoples Movement on Debt and Development and another observer on the funds board.\nThe funds growing pains reflect the competing pressures  from its donors, from the private sector, and from the countries it is meant to assist. Eager to show taxpayers back home that the fund is being put to work, donor countries have put pressure on the fund to ramp up its disbursements. Similar pressures arise from banks need to raise private investment to make up for the expected shortfall in contributions from industrialized countries.\nThe funds secretariat did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But in response to some of these criticisms, the bank has adopted a monitoring framework meant to strengthen transparency at the fund. The fund also recently set up an independent evaluation unit to assess the effectiveness of its projects.\nI hope we can learn, and learn fast, about what works for climate change action, Jyotsna Puri, the head of the new unit, said in an interview posted on the funds site last month. Otherwise, just imagine the waste of resources.\nFor places like Kiribati, the stakes couldnt be higher. Much of the country, a string of atolls and reef islands that straddles the Equator, lies no higher than six feet above sea level. The prospect of rising seas and more extreme storms threatens the very existence of large segments of the population, the government has said.\nOfficials in Kiribati have said they desperately need funding for desalination plants to provide safe water for the 110,000 residents of country, where much of the water has become contaminated by seawater intrusion into groundwater. The government is also seeking to elevate land on its main atoll and invest in renewable energy to end the countrys almost complete reliance on fossil fuels.\nBut with little diplomatic and financial heft, officials have struggled to secure funding.\nWe cant do it alone, the president of Kiribati, Taneti Mamau, said in a video message before the Bonn meeting. We need the hands of our partners and those who are ready to assist.\nThe fund has pledged to improve the quality of its projects. It is also working to improve access for countries applying for smaller projects of less than $10 million.\nUnfortunately so far, we have not taken the observers comments into consideration for our decision. That is true, said Omar El-Arini, a member of the climate funds board. He stressed that his personal views were not representative of the entire board.\nBut we just started. There are competing interests  from countries, from the private sector, and we are trying to wade through this maze of conflicting interests, he said. We will get there.\nKiribati scored a small victory this year when it qualified for a $586,000 grant to help the country prepare a new application to the fund.\nThe island nation, however, has also taken some heart-wrenching measures.\nIn 2014, Kiribati bought 8 square miles of land in Fiji, more than a thousand miles away, as an insurance policy against the rising oceans.\nMr. Mamau stressed that migration from Kiribati would be an absolute last resort.\nThe idea is to build Kiribatis resilience, he said. We dont believe that Kiribati will sink like the Titanic.\nFollow @NYTClimate on Twitter\nCredit: By HIROKO TABUCHI\n'b'I am angry at the smoke!\nI am angry at my sore throat.

"He made the decision to reject the Paris deal."\nSpicer was asked the same question - and answered similarly.\nCredit: BY Adam Edelman\n'b'A first step in an effort to roll back environmental protections, Donald Trump is attempting to remove federal requirements that regulate the fuel efficiency of new cars and trucks by re-examining the Obama administrations 2012 rule, issued by the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Transportation, to increase fuel economy to the equivalent of 54.5 mpg for cars and trucks by 2025.\nMeant to encourage automakers to develop and market new technologies that reduce fuel consumption the rule was originally supported by13 major auto manufacturers, but with a president who doesnt believe in climate change, a new EPA head who denies basic climate science, and the influence of big oil, that support has now vanished.\nMileage standards save consumers money at the pump, make Americans less dependent on foreign oil, reduce carbon pollution and ultimately motivate the development of market leading technologies that drove the resurgence of the auto industry in America.\nUndoing the fuel economy standards will lead to costly litigation and create uncertainty for the auto industry, threatening the economic and employment gains automakers have made in recent years. Americans will continue to pay more at the pump, depend more on foreign oil, drive up the trade deficit and pollute our childrens atmosphere.\n\nJordan Schwab,\n\n\nMissoula\n\n'b'The press ombudsman and Press Council of Ireland have rejected a complaint by Ray Bates against an article that called the retired University College Dublin meteorology professor a "climate contrarian", writes Valerie Flynn. \nJohn Gibbons, an environmental campaigner, referred to Bates in an article in Village magazine in June. Bates complained that the piece accused him of being a "climate-change denier" and "not a bona-fide practising expert in climate science". He said the article and a follow-up in July breached press code requirements to be truthful and accurate, to respect people\'s right to their good name, and to not be prejudiced.\nThe ombudsman found of these principles had been breached, a finding that was upheld this month by the press council following an appeal. The ombudsman said the articles associated Bates with climate change deniers, but did not state he was one.\nIn his ruling, the ombudsman said he was "not required to take sides in the climate change argument" or "decide which protagonist is correct", but he was "conscious that Bates holds views which are at variance with the views of most of the scientific community".\nBates published a paper last year on "equilibrium climate sensitivity", an important calculation in climate science that estimates the change in temperature that would result from a doubling of atmosnone pheric CO2. Bates estimates this doubling would cause a 1C rise in global warming.\nHowever, this is at odds with the predictions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the UN body that represents the scientific consensus on climate change. A 2013 IPCC report said that climate sensitivity of 1C was "extremely unlikely", whereas it had "medium confidence" in climate sensitivity of between 1.5C and 4.5C.\nThis weekend, Bates said his findings were new and did not mean he was a contrarian.\nHe said: "Any article that has been peer-reviewed, and mine was peer-reviewed by five reviewers, is mainstream science." He added that he felt he had been left worse off by having made a complaint, as the ombudsman\'s ruling contained further negative statements to which he had not been given a right of reply.\nGibbons said the rulings were "incredibly important" as they defended "legitimate media scrutiny of those touting contrarian arguments". His June article concluded that "lousy ideas, peddled by mostly elderly, mostly white, mostly once-respected retired academics are elbowing their way into the public square".\nThe ombudsman noted that the editor of Village had refused to give Bates a right of reply in the magazine because he has a policy of not publishing "scientifically or factually contrarian articles on important issues".\n\n'b'President Trump made the wrong decision for our health and the planet in pulling the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement. Climate change threatens our health with dirtier air, more extreme weather and spreading disease. The United States is most responsible for global warming, and now were leaving other countries to clean up our mess or suffer.\nBut losing Paris wont only compromise our nations position in the international arena. Casting aside our emissions goals could have serious consequences right here in Montana.\nMontanas dwindling glaciers have already made headline news across the world. Global warming is also extending and worsening the wildfire season here, causing unhealthy air quality conditions for months out of every year. And it will only get worse: scientists predict that wildfire burn areas will be six times larger in western Montana if we dont curb emissions soon.\nIf Washington wont lead, we all need to step up. Its time for Gov. Steve Bullock to stand up and lead Montana to a 100 percent renewable energy future. Its time for U.S. Sens. Jon Tester and Steve Daines to step up and defend important climate-friendly measures like the clean cars standards that will clean our air and reduce emissions.\n\nSarah Luth,\n\n\nMissoula\n\n'b'WASHINGTON * Tens of thousands of demonstrators assembled in Washington on Saturday in sweltering heat for the latest installment of the regular protests that punctuate the Trump era. This large-scale climate march marks President Donald Trump\'s first 100 days in office, which have been marked by multiple rollbacks of environmental protections and climate policies set under then-President Barack Obama.\nThe People\'s Climate March, which originated with a massive demonstration in New York in September 2014, picked a symbolically striking day for its 2017 event. Temperatures were nudging the area\'s record high for April 29 in the District of Columbia, amplifying the movement\'s message.\nOn the eve of the march, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that it was beginning an overhaul of its website, which included taking down a long-standing site devoted to the science of climate change, which the agency said was "under review."\n"Hang on EPA, the midterms are coming. 2018," read one sign carried by Kathy Sommer of Stony Brook, N.Y., as the protest assembled on the National Mall Saturday morning.\nMany of the signs at Saturday\'s climate march were ominous, warning of dying oceans and crop destruction . But the mood of the marchers was anything but somber. Tens of thousands gathered in the lush green Mall in front of the U.S. Capitol carrying signs, singing and chanting on their way to the White House. It was a racially diverse crowd with marchers of all ages.\nThe climate event differs from last week\'s March for Science in its focus and also its participants  only 1 out of 8 contingents in Saturday\'s protest featured scientific researchers. The rest included labor activists, indigenous people already facing severe effects from climate change, and children and young people who will live with the effects longest as the Earth continues to warm.\nBut there\'s plenty of overlap between the marches. Ken Hunter, 78, traveled from Charlestown, W.Va., for Saturday morning\'s march. He also came to Washington for the March for Science last weekend and the Tax March on April 15  and attended a Women\'s March in Florida.\n"Hell, I haven\'t marched this much in years," said Hunter with a laugh. "But these are all very important issues and it was important to be out here."\nPOLICY ISSUES\nThe motivation for the climate march is clear: The young Trump administration already has moved to roll back former Obama\'s signature climate initiative, the Clean Power Plan, and Trump and his team have taken many other actions to weaken environmental protections of air and water, and to enable fossil fuel exploitation on public lands and waters.\nThe administration is grappling with a major climate policy decision: whether to remain in the Paris climate agreement. Several of Trump\'s Cabinet picks are advising against following through on his campaign pledge to "cancel" the accord.\nThe original People\'s Climate March in 2014 was aimed at rallying support for climate change action and preceded the Paris climate agreement by about a year. This event is much more targeted at resisting rollbacks of climate efforts. Celebrity attendees included Leonardo DiCaprio, Al Gore and Richard Branson.\nThe focus on Trump was not necessarily intentional: In a press statement, Paul Getsos, national coordinator of the People\'s Climate Movement, said the event was planned "before the election."\nOrganizers told the National Park Service that they expected 50,000 to 100,000 attendees. More than 375 marches were planned around the United States and even more around the world, from Manila to Amsterdam.\nAROUND THE NATION\nDemonstrators marched in climate rallies across the U.S. Organizers said about 300 sister marches or rallies were being held around the country, including in Seattle, Boston and San Francisco. A wet spring snow fell in Denver, where several hundred activists posed in the shape of a giant thermometer for a photograph and a dozen people rode stationary bikes to power the loudspeakers. In Chicago, a rain-soaked crowd of thousands headed from the city\'s federal plaza to Trump Tower.\n"We are here because there is no Planet B," the Rev. Mariama White-Hammond of Bethel AME Church told a rally in Boston.\nThe demonstrations came a week after supporters of science gathered in 600 cities around the globe, alarmed by political and public rejection of established research on topics including climate change and the safety of vaccines.\nParticipants Saturday said they objected to Trump\'s rollback of restrictions on mining, oil drilling and greenhouse gas emissions at coal-fired power plants, among other things. Trump has called climate change a hoax, disputing the overwhelming consensus of scientists that the world is warming and that man-made carbon emissions are primarily to blame.\nAmong those attending the Chicago rally were members of the union representing Environmental Protection Agency employees. Trump has proposed cutting the EPA\'s budget by almost a third, eliminating more than 3,000 jobs.\nJohn O\'Grady, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, called the march "a chance to speak out in unity against this administration" and its "ridiculous gutting of the EPA budget and staffing."\nMore than 2,000 people gathered at the Maine State House in Augusta. Speakers included a lobsterman, a solar company owner and members of the Penobscot Nation tribe.\n"I\'ve seen firsthand the impacts of climate change to not only the Gulf of Maine, but also to our evolving fisheries, and to the coastal communities that depend upon them," said lobsterman Richard Nelson of Friendship, Maine.\nPeople in the crowd spoke about the importance of addressing climate change to industries such as renewable energy, forestry, farming and seafood. Saharlah Farah, 16, an immigrant from Somalia who lives in Portland, talked about how climate change could take a bigger toll on marginalized groups that have less financial resources.\n"But I see untapped power here today," she said.\nA demonstration stretched for several blocks in downtown Tampa, Fla., where marchers said they were concerned about the threat rising seas pose to the city.\nPeople gathered on the Boston Common carried signs with slogans such as "Dump Trump." Handmade signs at Seattle\'s march included the general  "Love Life"  and the specific  "Don\'t Kill Otters."\nIn Montpelier, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called the marches part of a fight for the future of the planet.\nCredit: From news services; The Washington Post and Associated Press contributed to this report.\nCaption: Participants walk along Pennsylvania Ave., in front of the White House in Washington, during a demonstration and march, Saturday, April 29, 2017.

Scott Walker's plan to shut down the self-supporting, nearly  100-year-old publication.\nThe state Department of Natural Resources received 1,394  subscription orders in the eight days between Feb. 13 and last  Wednesday, DNR spokesman Jim Dick said Monday. \nIn a typical week, no more than a few hundred orders come in  without a boost from the holiday gift-giving season or a  promotional effort, said Natasha Kassulke, a former editor who says  plans to eliminate the magazine fit the DNR's pattern under Walker  of undercutting climate science and environmental education. \nThe DNR recently curtailed the options offered to subscribers and  prepared a financial projection based on cutting off new  subscriptions in July and publishing the last issue in January. \nDick and Walker spokesman Tom Evenson have denied that the plan was  part of an anti-science agenda. Eliminating the magazine would free  the DNR to focus on other responsibilities, while it continues to  educate the public about conservation issues through other means,  they said. \nThe DNR and another state agency recently removed climate change  information from their websites, while a third banned employees  from discussing the topic in 2015, the same year the Legislature  approved Walker budget cuts targeting DNR educators and scientists. \nThe federally funded researchers examined ways the state can  prepare for climate change and compiled studies on the water  pollution potential of mining. \nKassulke and other former DNR personnel have said the magazine was  a crucial tool for helping Wisconsin residents understand how they  can aid conservation efforts. \nArticles in the magazine explore the science behind the  department's work, as well as the options available for protecting  air, water and wildlife. \nDick didn't respond to requests for numbers of subscription orders  received at other times. He confirmed, though, that the DNR this  month eliminated options for two- and three-year subscriptions. \nShuttering of the magazine is part of Walker's 2017-19 budget  proposal, which the Legislature will soon begin reviewing. \nThe DNR began limiting subscriptions to a single year after Walker  announced his budget on Feb. 8, Dick said. \nThe DNR isn't concerned about the possibility that turning away  longer-term subscriptions will undercut the magazine's future  revenue in the event the Legislature decides to allow the magazine  to continue, Dick said. \nThe nearly 1,400 subscription orders came in during the eight-day  period after articles about Walker's plan to cut the magazine ran  in the Wisconsin State Journal and other newspapers. At the same  time, environmental reporter James Rowen urged his readers to  subscribe in his blog. \nInitially, the governor's office explained the budget proposal by  saying the state shouldn't duplicate privately owned periodicals. \nA spokesman hasn't responded to requests for examples but three  private, Wisconsin-based publishers last week told the State  Journal they don't compete with the DNR magazine and they didn't  ask Walker to eliminate it. \nThe DNR's Dick provided the State Journal with a financial  projection indicating the magazine can stop accepting new  subscriptions on July 1 and still have just enough revenue socked  away to reimburse the roughly $300,000 that would be owed to  subscribers if the last issue were to be published in January. \nBut Kassulke, who resigned as editor last summer, said a consulting  company told her in 2015 that ceasing publication would cost closer  to $700,000 because in addition to reimbursements the DNR would  also face costs of sending first-class notices to subscribers,  cutting checks, mailing them and administering the process. \nThe DNR's projection counts on $9 in revenue from each of 40,000  people who subscribe automatically when they purchase a $165  conservation patron license. But Kassulke said the magazine has  received only about $6 per license in the past. \nWalker's budget proposal said conservation patrons would save  $375,000 during the two-year budget period. The cost of the license  would decrease by $6, Dick said. \nThe DNR projection was based on publication of 75,000 copies of  each issue of the magazine, including about 40,000 for conservation  patrons and 35,877 individual subscribers who pay about $8.97  annually for six issues. \nKassulke said the magazine had about 88,000 subscribers before she  left last year to accept a job at UW-Madison. The 88,000 included  about 40,000 conservation patrons and another roughly 48,000  individual subscribers. \nA 2014-15 DNR survey of 660 conservation patron license holders  found that 63 percent said they read most or all of the magazine,  25 percent read some of it and 13 percent read little or none. The  survey had a margin of error of 3.7 percent.\nCredit: STEVEN VERBURG sverburg@madison.com\nCaption: WISCONSIN NATURAL RESOURCES MAGAZINE\n"
