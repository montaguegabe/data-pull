Has anyone taken an engineering approach to global warming?,http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/c72p2/has_anyone_taken_an_engineering_approach_to/,/r/askscience/comments/c72p2/has_anyone_taken_an_engineering_approach_to/,"Has anyone done a study to see if the increase in temperature that is being measured on land and in the ocean could actually be caused by the common sources that are pointed to as driving global warming?

I mean, if we know about how much total water is in the oceans and we know the specific heat of the water and we know how much the temperature has increased over the past 10 years (or any other time period for that matter), it shouldn't be hard to determine the total energy required to cause this change.

Also, I would think that we would be able to get an approximate number for the amount of energy being added to the oceans from the sources that are commonly blamed for global warming.  

If you compare the energy needed to raise the water temperature with the actual amount of energy from the accepted global warming sources, it should be pretty easy to see if the accepted sources are ACTUALLY causing the warming or if something else is in play.

I just had a brief debate with 2 guys regarding climate change, both suggesting that the theory of climate change is flawed, has wrong facts, and that climate change might in fact be ALL about the sun affecting the earth, and that the increased CO2 is not due to human causes but from natural phenomenons. 

Things like that could sound reasonable to a layman like me who has no degree in anything dealing with climate change. I was linked this: 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYnLbz8ZoTE

http://www.weatheraction.com/

and here's the wiki page i checked for some facts:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_controversy


It seems to me the main points of their case are ( I could be mistaken):

1. The sun affects the earth climate and explains all changes that's been measured so far that climate change supporters are saying is due to man made pollution
2. The facts used to support the man made pollution theory are flawed/wrong (I did not specifically find out what those facts were)

My main thought is, yes of course the sun affects the earth, but is that really enough explanation for all changes?

I am wondering why it should be so high on the list of concerns for people.  It appears that the direct health effects of pollution or the uncertainty of our food sources or a vast number of other things present more of a threat to human and animal life on earth.  Carbon dioxide is the most harmless waste product that humans produce.  I am aware that ice will disappear, oceans will rise, extreme weather conditions will occur, poor people will starve from droughts and floods, cities will be flooded and moved, polar bears, penguins, and coral will die, and many other things.  These things suck, but they already occur on large scales and will always occur to some degree.  The earth is constantly changing and requiring life to evolve.  If it gets too warm, can't people just move towards vacant land in Canada, Scandinavia, and Russia that was previously too cold to farm and live comfortably?  Can't the extra available fresh water benefit the majority of farmers?  In higher temperatures, can't more plant life thrive and produce more oxygen and balance everything out?

Does nuclear energy contribute substantially to global warming via heat dissipation of the electricity produced?,http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/f2ea4/does_nuclear_energy_contribute_substantially_to/,/r/askscience/comments/f2ea4/does_nuclear_energy_contribute_substantially_to/,"When you split an atom to create all sorts of energy, then distribute that energy as electricity, then let it dissipate as heat, you've added heat to the environment (and removed a tiny bit of mass).  

The same would be true for coal and oil, but as far as I can tell, not for wind, solar, hydro, geo, etc, which remove energy that would have been in the environment anyway (not stored as mass or in coal/oil).  

So my question is:  is this effect negligible compared to the greenhouse effect of coal burning?  Is, for instance, the amount of warming caused by the greenhouse gases released while burning a million tons of coal vastly greater than the amount of warming caused by the heat dissipation of the electricity produced by that same 1 million tons?

If all forms of electromagnetic radiation can heat matter do radio broadcasts contribute to global climate change?,http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/f45bw/if_all_forms_of_electromagnetic_radiation_can/,/r/askscience/comments/f45bw/if_all_forms_of_electromagnetic_radiation_can/,"I really don't know where to look for this kind of study.

As such are man-made radio waves imparting energy into the atmosphere? Would this energy be negligible in terms of global climate?

Is this a silly question and why?

Edit: Thank you so much for the answers, science! TIL that the total output of humankind's broadcasts isn't large enough to make that much of a difference.

From my understanding, weather (cold fronts, warm fronts, hurricanes, etc) is nature's pressure release valve. Global warming is  heating up the world and creating more energy (causing more pressure to build up) and so we have more severe weather not just in the summer when it's hot, but all year round.

But is this having a severe impact on our climate? Not really.
And the Milankovitch cycles correspond exactly to the peaks in temperature these people whine about. Also, the correlation between CO2 levels and global temperature is highly misinterpreted. If you glance at any graph, you'll realize that the temperatures rose 800 years before the CO2 levels started rising. In fact, the latter is a result of the former and not as falsely popularized, otherwise.

Most of the warming occurred before 1940 when industrialization was really a newbie. One would believe that if global warming is directly dependent CO2 it would accelerate in the post WWII period, but it didn't. The globe actually cooled for 4 decades after WWII, when industrialization was the at its peak. Also, try taking a look at our atmosphere's greenhouse gas compositions. CO2 makes up only 'round about .03% of our atmosphere. Other greenhouse gases, predominantly water vapor make up about 4% of the atmosphere. All human activity combined produces 6.5Gt of CO2 per year. Volcanoes alone exceed that number. All animals combined (meaning respiration, decomposition, etc) produce 150Gt of CO2.

"What feedback effects will eventually not only halt, but actually reverse global warming?",http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/hp9ls/what_feedback_effects_will_eventually_not_only/,/r/askscience/comments/hp9ls/what_feedback_effects_will_eventually_not_only/,"I was looking at [this graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EPICA_temperature_plot.svg) of Antarctic temperature fluctuations over the last 800,000 years. Assuming these temperature fluctuations roughly track average earth temperatures (is this a reasonable assumption?), there are clearly cycles of warming, with the temperature reaching a peak, then suddenly reversing.

I'm familiar with some of the positive feedback effects that have a tendency to *accelerate* global warming (e.g., the [ice-albedo effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice-albedo_feedback) and [Arctic methane release](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_methane_release)).

I'm also familiar with [radiative cooling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_cooling), the process by which the earth's heat energy dissipates into space faster the warmer earth is. However, it seems to me that this negative feedback effect acts as a brake on both warming *and* cooling, so it can't actually reverse global warming, only slow it.

So my question is, what feedback effect(s) cause the sudden reversals from warming to cooling, and at what point might we expect these effects to occur in response to our current warming phase?

&gt;Sunspots, the enormous magnetic storms that erupt on the sun's surface as the cycle builds, might disappear entirely for the first time in approximately 400 years.
&gt;If the reported trends continueâ€”a big if, other researchers noteâ€”a hibernating sun would have only a slight cooling effect on climate

I'm not entirely so sure about that ""slight cooling effect on climate""... We know SO little about the Sun's cycles and solar variability (*especially* over timescales lasting more than several decades, since we barely monitored the Sun before a few decades ago). And assuming that this *big* IF happens, then the last time this happened was the time of the Maunder Minimum, when you had snowfall and freezing temperatures (in both Europe and North America) during SUMMER. I would hardly call that ""a slight cooling effect"" (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maunder_minimum#Little_Ice_Age) - although if it happens again, I don't think it will be as severe as what happened during the Maunder minimum. 

In fact, my fear is that it would entirely discredit the climate modelling community just because they neglected solar variability. Already, I'm afraid that the climate modelling community (along with the broader scientific community, which has vehemently defended the modelling community) might be discredited (by the popular opinion) in 5-10 years, because there are other cycles that can cause an apparent lapse in global warming for around a decade (it's just that the warming in the 1990s was superimposed upon a warming part of the possible cycle, and we now might be heading towards the cooler phase of that cycle, which explains why the last 10 years haven't really seen much of a strong warming trend): 

http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-Issues/2008/0501/p25s01-wogi.html

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29469287/ns/us_news-environment/

But it might give us a lucky break of several decades.

That being said, I'm definitely not counting or betting on that happening, and do not think the argument should be a factor towards laxer policies towards CO2 mitigation. Even if it did happen, I highly doubt it would result in anything similar to the repeat of the Maunder Minimum. I'm just anticipating that this *could* be possible, and that if it is possible, then we must at least prepare for its slight possibility (and that maybe we can't completely be 95% confident that global warming is going to be as catastrophic as the IPCC thinks it is).

By the way, I actually work with climate modellers, and am in no way sympathetic to skeptics of anthropogenic global warming (although I do have a fair amount of respect for both Dyson and Lomborg, though I don't like it how Dyson also tries to use some of the more scientifically irresponsible arguments). I am open to alternative sides of the data and interpretations, since I'm still just learning (and haven't gone through the entire IPCC pdf yet). 

With all that being said, does anyone think that the emerging field of http://kepler.nasa.gov/Science/about/RelatedScience/Asteroseismology/ could help us better quantify variations in the solar output (especially in the past?)

Sunrise can come early to the polar regions due the optical illusion called a [MIRAGE](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Mirage_of_astronomical_objects)

[See this description from 1992](http://www.washington.edu/burkemuseum/endurance/spstories.html)

&gt; SUNRISE Tuesday 22 September 1992 by Stephen G. Warren

&gt; The South Pole sunrise began two weeks early with the Sun still at five degrees North latitude. On September 8th, a calm day with an extreme temperature inversion causing bizarre distortions of the horizon, Dan, Kitt and Paul saw the Sun rise in an amazing mirage, then set again after just five minutes: a mirage that was last reported at such a large angle 400 years ago when [Barents saw it](http://arctic.synergiesprairies.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/viewFile/1055/1081) [PDF] at the island of [Novaya Zemlya](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Novaya_Zemlya_effect) in the Arctic Ocean in 1597.

&gt; The rest of us had to wait almost till Equinox to see the Sun. On Sunday the 20th I gave myself a birthday treat, taking a day off to write letters by the window as a blizzard raged outside. By evening the winds had weakened and we were allowed a brief break in the storm. The blowing snow began to settle, revealing the horizon, but there was still no sign of the Sun when I went to bed. At 2:30 am Jarvis knocked on my door to wake me: ""The Sun is rising!"" He prodded several of us up to the picture windows in the Skylab lounge; others stumbled outside to have a look. And it was beautiful. I had been learning the Beatles' song ""Here Comes The Sun;"" now I played it on my recorder over the loudspeaker to alert the whole station.

&gt; The upper limb of the orange disk threw off green flashes occasionally for two hours, just like at sunset six months ago. Then the clouds closed in, but we all knew the Sun had now returned for good. 

**So the Question is:**

*Is climate change producing more mirages, leading to these reports of earlier sunrise and sunsets in the arctic?*

If you look at [this chart](http://www.john-daly.com/stations/WestPoint-NY.gif), comparing almost 200 years of temperature data between two locations only 50 miles apart, you will see the obvious ""urban heat island effect"" that causes weather stations to record hotter temperatures due to increasing human development in certain areas (The ""urban"" designation is something of a misnomer, as a weather station can easily be [affected by suburban land-use changes as well](http://gallery.surfacestations.org/main.php?g2_itemId=617)).

Now, the surface temperature data compiled by GISS, CRU, and others is based on this biased data. Instead of throwing out the stations affected by UHI, they simply adjust the data with computer programs. Is this good science?

Then they take that data and feed it into climate modeling computer programs. So we have data that has already been tweaked and now they are running simulations based on it, so you're going to have problems with correlations due to the adjustments. Right? I mean, how are these climate models not just fancy data-mining for the ""right"" results?

Furthermore a model that is focused on the effects on carbon dioxide will show, who would have guessed it, large effects of carbon dioxide! In fact I understand that some of the models introduce exponential ""feedback"" effects that, depending on the variables entered, will cause the model to spin out of control! How does this model accurately depict reality.

Now, this first part of my question deals solely with the surface temperature record, the CO2 concentration record, and the attempts made to model the relationship on a worldwide level. That is part of the theory of global warming: The idea that you can model the relationship between temperature and CO2 for the last 100 years, and find not just a correlation between the two, but actual cause and effect.

I think that area of the science needs to recognize the limitations of computer models and not suggest that the models are actually speaking about reality. It looks more like data-mining to me.

That gets to the second, more interesting question regarding the theory of anthropogenic global warming: Is the current climate significantly warmer, geologically speaking, than the climate of the past X years (Where even the decision about what X should be seems like an important scientific question)? 

When you ask this question, you are really posing a Popperian theory of reality. Karl Popper famously explained, ""In so far as a scientific statement speaks about reality, it must be falsifiable; and in so far as it is not falsifiable, it does not speak about reality.""

So in order to ask the question properly, first you need to have a ""null hypothesis"" that accounts for the natural variation in climate across the Earth's geological history. Do we include the ice age cycle as part of that? Do we look at just the past 100 years, 1000 years, 10,000? 100,000? Then what data sources do you use, and how could you possibly compare reconstructions of past temperature to surface station data from modern times (Assuming it has not been corrupted by UHI effects)?

Then, assuming the two data sets (the reconstruction and the measured data) are comparable, what standard would you have to set to be sure that the difference is significant?

All in all, I don't see how this science matches up to normal hard sciences, where you can run experiments and get a reliable answer about the state of reality. Where am I mistaken here?

They also mention that the amount of sulfur dioxide needed for it to be effective is only a small fraction of what is already being sent into the atmosphere - the difference being this will be sent into the stratosphere.

At that point I [was surprised to find this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_stick_controversy): 

&gt; The [US government] report stated that the MBH method creates a hockey-stick shape even when supplied with random input data (Figure 4.4), and argues that the MBH method uses weather station data from 1902 to 1995 as a basis for calibrating other input data. ""It is not clear that Dr. Mann and his associates even realized that their methodology was faulty at the time of writing the MBH paper. The net effect of the decentering is to preferentially choose the so-called hockey stick shapes."" 

The only response is a link to the RealClimate blog showing what the graph ""would have looked like"" without MBH manipulation. If their mock-up is accurate, then why hasn't there been an official correction to remove the manipulations? I don't think the scientific process ends with the ""real facts"" being provided by blogs. Why hasn't the original, messed up version been officially redacted by the people who published it, since [data that lacks Mann's ""adjustment""](http://i.imgur.com/TR45p.jpg) doesn't look like a hockey stick at all?

I plead utter ignorance on this subject, I'm no scientist. Reddit, help me out.

Bonus question: is the relationship between atmospheric CO2 and temperature logarithmic, as claimed [here](http://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/03/08/the-logarithmic-effect-of-carbon-dioxide/)? I'm pretty sure this isn't true but can't find a discussion of it anywhere that rebuts the data presented.",2011-10-11,20:21:43,2,l8xr3
Climate change: Why do we always plot temperature as a function of time instead of the rate of change?,http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/l8xj6/climate_change_why_do_we_always_plot_temperature/,/r/askscience/comments/l8xj6/climate_change_why_do_we_always_plot_temperature/,"When debating climate change (let's not get into too much detail here) one common argument is that the mean temperature of Earth has been warmer in the past than the present temperature. This is usually countered by ""it's the accelerating rate of temperature change that's alarming, not the absolute value"".

As the title says, my question is why we always plot the temperature versus time instead of the temperature *rate of change* (i.e., the derivative dT/dt ~ Î”T/Î”t). Are there any plots like that available?

----
I can see a few problems with this. For example, in the historical values there are a lot of interpolation/extrapolation going on. If we draw a straight line between two points the rate of change there would be constant. This could be seen as misleading. However, doesn't the same problem exist in the temperature vs time plot when we draw straight lines between points?

Another thing to consider is that it's easier for the general public to understand a plot of temperature over time. But if it truly is the rate of change that's the most important part, I would argue that it's more helpful with a plot that shows how the temperature currently increases at an alarming rate, and it would avoid arguments like the one I mentioned in the beginning. Now I don't know how such a plot would look like - are there other examples in history where the temperature changed very fast? (Ice ages etc.?)",2011-10-11,20:16:01,19,l8xj6

I was a scientist by trade, and if smart scientists besides me accept in huge numbers that it's happening, I have little choice but to accept it.

What I'd like is some clarification. I'll raise my concerns point by point:

1. I may be wrong from the premise. What sort of precise granularity/precision do we have when it comes to ice cores? I can't really find much in regards to that.
    
2. We have far more granularity w.r.t. climate data over the past 100 years than we've ever had. Ice cores are supposedly a reliable data source for CO2 content in the semi-recent past; is there any any backup for that data?
    
3. If not, why is it that the ice-cores are accepted so religiously despite the lack of long-term observations of antarctic surface deposition? 
    
4. If it so happens that we do have a reliable backup source of CO2 data, what is/are they and how do they happen to back up the data? 
    
5. Finally, is there any historical evidence that increased CO2 levels have led to disaster? I'm well aware of the simulations, but I'd like to know if similar non-anthropogenic CO2 increases have happened in the past, and their consequences.

Sorry about having to code that, but the numbers got screwy without it.

It's not very controversial that the Maunder minimum caused the Little Ice age, I don't think. The Sporer minimum has also been identified as a massive cooling period. 

The trend on that graph above indicates that sun spots peak in the 70s which would explain the buzz about aerosol ruining the environment and causing temperature rises. It's also clear that the sunspots have had a much higher frequency in the past 50 years, relative to the past couple hundred years.

- some fixed light comparable to thats of the sun.

Then you calculate the temperature at equilibrium (it may be far from the current temperature, it doesn't matter).
Then you add 10 year of man-made CO2 and see the difference in temperature.
If you see a non-negligible difference in temperature, it means that the influence of human is non negligible --&gt; end of the debate.

Perhaps there are retroactive mechanisms we don't know about, but it doesn't matter, if our influence may be non-negligible, it is dangerous (for us).

I'm asking a serious question.  I am genuinely curious.**

Nuclear war is clearly a bad thing -- I'm certainly not rooting for it.  But as a purely intellectual matter, I am curious.  On a global scale, according to experts, the Earth is dying due to excessive pollution and subsequent destruction of the oceans and global warming, *so*...

If the effect of nuclear war is to remove a substantial fraction of humanity from the environmental equation, as well as introduce a temporary nuclear winter that could help refreeze the polar ice caps, then assuming that all of humanity was not completely obliterated and knowledge and technology preserved to some extent, wouldn't global thermonuclear war be a good thing for planet Earth?

I'm making a few assumptions here:

   1. ""Clean"" bombs have low radioactive waste after detonation.
   2. Only major/military cities would likely be targets of nuclear weaponry.  (Why blow up Yosemite park or Cuba?)

A large fraction of humanity going away means:

   * Substantially lower CO2 and other greenhouse gas production
   * Cooler temperatures to help stabilize the polar caps and prevent runaway methane release
   * Substantially less pollution and a lower volume of plastics reaching the ocean
   * Increased job prospects resulting in less global strife and fewer future wars
   * Decreased use of non-renewable resources
   * Recovery period for endangered animal species
   * Large quantities of recyclable raw materials available for recovery (steel, copper, etc.)
   * More land and food available


(As a related question, shouldn't we be in favor of increased plastic production?  Every barrel of oil that is burned for electricity is more co2 and other pollutants put into the air.  Every barrel of oil turned to plastic is eventually CO2 sequestered in a landfill, so long as it actually ends up in the landfill and not in the ocean.  What's the difference between oil in the ground and plastic in the landfill?)",2011-12-10,13:31:11,11,n7lk4

I've been reading through the past year's askscience threads on this subject, as well as the skepticalscience site, but I still have a few honest questions.  (I have not delved into the IPCC papers yet.)

The party line is that climate change is a political/scientific conspiracy:

* There are only a few sources of primary data
* Those sets of data have been manipulated
* Climate scientists have a conflict of interest because concern over climate change results in more funding and jobs for them
* Politically liberal big government types are trying to use climate change as an opportunity to remake society rather than genuinely dealing with the problem - like the [""What if we create a better world for nothing?""](http://i.imgur.com/gI6zW.jpg) cartoon, but more cynical.

I *do not question* that the data presented by scientists/researchers points to a long term increase in temperature.  It obviously does.

My first four questions have to do with ""Climategate"".  I know there was a big to-do over the climate data from East Anglia University being ""adjusted"" in several ways.  I also know that other scientists reviewed those adjustments and supported what was done.

1.  How important was the CRUTEM data in persuading most climate researches of anthropogenic climate change?  I'm guessing that 97% of climate scientists don't have access to data independently and just have to go off what other researchers provide.
1.  What process did they use in deciding how to adjust the data?  Do we know if any points were revised downward (e.g., to account for urban heat islands) or was it all revised upwards?
1.  Are there other significant, independent sets of data (which have not been similarly ""adjusted"") that confirm the CRUTEM data?
1.  How important were the CRU scientists themselves in the IPCC?
1.  Is there a conflict of interest with climate scientists generally?  Is this like asking a drug manufacturer if the medicine is good for you?  Is it the case that increased concern of climate change translates into more jobs and funding in that area?  If so, what does that mean about the reliability of the data and its interpretation?
1.  How are the effects of CO2 emissions on climate separated from that of other factors that may be outside human control (increased solar radiation, ocean currents, etc)?
1.  How can a couple of degrees of warming over a century really be significant?
1.  Do models predict whether enough new areas would become inhabitable and productive to offset the loss of other areas?
1.  If we approximately maintained our levels of CO2 emissions, would the warming continue to increase indefinitely, or would it eventually level off and if so at what level?
1.  Are there viable, or even promising, technological solutions (""bright green"") that would allow us to maintain our current social and economic practices while avoiding a climate disaster?  (I'm thinking of things like solar and nuclear energy, carbon sequestration, etc.)
1.  To what extent are scientists, policymakers, and environmental advocates pushing for ""bright green"" solutions as opposed to ""dark green"" ones?
1.  How would you refute the notion that this is being used as an opportunity for ""big government liberals"" to grab power and push an alternate form of society on us?

Thanks!

A paper published in the Journal of Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics makes a novel argument against global warming. Can anyone tell me if &amp; why this is wrong?,http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/nqcax/a_paper_published_in_the_journal_of/,/r/askscience/comments/nqcax/a_paper_published_in_the_journal_of/,"The abstract:

&gt; Physical, mathematical and observational grounds are employed to show that there is no physically meaningful global temperature for the Earth in the context of the issue of global warming. While it is always possible to construct statistics for any given set of local temperature data, an infinite range of such statistics is mathematically permissible if physical principles provide no explicit basis for choosing among them. Distinct and equally valid statistical rules can and do show opposite trends when applied to the results of computations from physical models and real data in the atmosphere. A given temperature field can be interpreted as both ""warming"" and ""cooling"" simultaneously, making the concept of warming in the context of the issue of global warming physically ill-posed.

Why people freak out so much in fear of Climate Change?,http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/nyz05/why_people_freak_out_so_much_in_fear_of_climate/,/r/askscience/comments/nyz05/why_people_freak_out_so_much_in_fear_of_climate/,"Question 1: How likely is that we won't even get a few weeks warning of ice caps melting/flooding the earth?

Question 2: Is it technically feasible to live completely in the ocean without using any land whatsoever?

Question 3: Is it possible to cyclone/earthquake/flood proof your building if money isn't an issue? 

Let me clarify this first. I am not a global warming denier. I know it is getting warmer and I know it is because of us. I also believe that we can observe a temperature change of approximately 6 degrees over the next few years. I am have a bachelor degree with understanding of Physics and Chemistry.

So now, here is my question.

Let's say ALL the ice in polar caps melts (I know it is unlikely but let's say it does). Let's assume worst case scenario. Albedo drops, earth becomes even warmer. Now I know most of land will come underwater and there will be MASS deaths but is it likely that humanity will be completely wiped out? I think, some groups will survive. I also think, most of our technology will survive (If our government's get a even a few weeks warning, they will collect the most essential personnel along with cronies and send them to the safest place on the planet). Those left behind will die, riot but well....fuck them.

So Question 1: How likely is that we won't even get a few weeks warning of ice caps melting/flooding the earth?

Furthermore, once that happens ALL the humanity will focus on making gadgets, improving technology to live underwater or at-least on surface of water. Our food source in short term will be seaweed, seafood, other sea crops...In long term, GM crops that grow on water will be invented in a relatively incredibly short period of time. 

So Question 2: Is it technically feasible to live completely in the ocean without using any land whatsoever?

The amount of money and attention we put in science is laughable, if not downright pathetic at best. Look back at the technological progress during the wars. Crisis encourages science. 

Now, on to the slow climate change. Let's say the frequency of tornadoes, cyclone, hurricanes, environmental disasters increases drastically. A lot of damage that natural disasters cause is because we are ill prepared for them. Look at Japan, they get crazy earth quakes but most of the time walk unscathed since they have earth quake resistant buildings and stuff. Of course, disasters like Fukushima happen but they are hardly civilization destroying. Also, almost everyone agrees it was handled poorly. Better communication, safety control would have helped a lot. So, when environment change occur, a lot of people die because of natural disasters but eventually things will rebound and governments will invest in infrastructure to make things same. Probably the poor African/Asian nations will die but....yeah fuck them.

So Question 3: Is it possible to cyclone/earthquake/flood proof your building if money isn't an issue? 

So, I just think that saving is not in our nature. We are not supposed to be conservatives. Let's say we fuck earth bad. Then, won't it just encourage us to improve geo-engineering of other planets, invest in space travel, invest in whatever condition we find ourselves in? Don't think about individual human suffering. Think about humanity as a WHOLE.

I've read a few non-mainstream sources (in the sense that they don't make the news, not that they're fringe scientific groups) suggest that once we hit about 2C of warming it'll kick in the feedback loops that'll send us as high as 6C or even 12C by the end of the century.  They also seem to be saying that anything much above 2C, and especially 6C and higher, is completely incompatible with human civilization as we know it, and will render large swaths of the planet uninhabitable (which may or may not include huge balls of methane rising from the ocean and wiping out entire continents in an apocalyptic fireball).

Compress air and make efficient use of the heat produced this way (e.g. Steam Engine). Thus lessening the heat impact on the environment. Use the container with compressed (liquid) air to freeze seawater (by evaporating the air) and store the ice on land (I nominate Greenland). We can also use the liquid air to fuel vehicles to transport the ice. While the vehicles are driving, they will cool the air. We can use renewable energy sources to power the pumps which compress the air.

I know desertification is a big problem. There are/were lakes that vanished, and enormous areas are inhabitable. We will need more water for plants even where we didn't need it before...  
But there are places where the water is the problem: drainage, ground-water, floods etc...

In this game, it was possible to nuke Earth so severely, that to paraphrase the game, you would ""boil off the oceans into space"",  or at least a large enough fraction of them so that it would permanently change the earth's ecology, and turn the whole planet into a hot desert.

This seemed troubling at the time, and still does, but it's also interesting.  I've been carrying this around in the back of my mind for 20 years, but I've never gotten around to consulting a meteorologist or climatologist.

In science fiction disaster scenarios, either global warming turns us into a Waterworld, or massive detonations throw stuff into the upper atmosphere, bringing on a nuclear winter.  Outside of the SimEarth game, I've never encountered a scenario where the oceans were lost, and Earth dried out.

So is this feasible, under any extreme conditions?  Any thoughts or suggestions for inquiry would be appreciated.  Thanks!

* In SimEarth, the player can vary a planet's atmosphere, temperature, landmasses, etc., then place various forms of life on the planet and watch them evolve. Since it is a software toy, the game does not have any required goals. The big (and difficult) challenge is to evolve sentient life and an advanced civilization. The development stages of the planet can be reverted and repeated, until the planet ""dies"" ten billion years after its creation, the estimated time when the Sun will become a red giant and kill off all of the planet's life.

Our highs and lows have been consistently well above average all winter.  I've heard that La Nina combined with the Artic Oscillation are reasons for this.  Is this just unusual weather?  Or is it a change in climate?  Could a reasonable case for global warming be made from this?  Or is it completely unrelated?,2012-01-31,12:32:58,9,p4rt2
George Carlin on Global Warming: is he accurate?,http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/p4pki/george_carlin_on_global_warming_is_he_accurate/,/r/askscience/comments/p4pki/george_carlin_on_global_warming_is_he_accurate/,"I'm sure many of you have seen this video, and if you haven't please take a look: 

[George Carlin on Global Warming](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB0aFPXr4n4)

Now, I am taking a Speech Class at my college, and our next speech has to be advocating for something; a persuasive speech. So as the teacher was explaining the assignment, the topic of Global Warming came up. Some people were saying how humans are ruining the eco-system, yadee yada, and I brought up how us as humans really won't destroy the earth in the end, and referenced George Carlin's performance.

The class combated with ""He's a comedian, not a scientist"", ""He doesn't know what he's talking about"", ect. I believe he makes a good point, and would love to argue and support what he's saying, but that's only if he *actually* makes a valid point that can be backed scientifically.

So just how right is the late George Carlin?

I am curious, however, if any studies have been performed which detail the impact that the heat from the burning process has on the global temperature.

I recognize that the Earth is not a closed thermodynamic system, but the heat must go somewhere, and the greenhouse gasses inhibit heat from radiating out from the earth.  Is heat from combustion negligible when compared to the heat absorbed from the sun and the heat that radiates outward from the molten core?

AS: I need your help for sources. What percent (if known) does man contribute to climate change?,http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/rr6gn/as_i_need_your_help_for_sources_what_percent_if/,/r/askscience/comments/rr6gn/as_i_need_your_help_for_sources_what_percent_if/,"I know that there are quite a few threads on climate change, but my question is for scientific papers that actually have a guess percent with the appropriate confidence interval.

My girlfriend and I were talking about climate change this morning, and I tried to explain that the general consensus is that climate change is primarily caused by human activity. She brought up that there are fluctuations in climate, so we can't discount a natural occurrence. I agreed. She asked me, ""Well, what percent do humans contribute to it?""

I don't know. I only knew that we could say that a majority of climate change is caused by humans. She pressed the issue that scientists could give a ballpark percentage. To which, I replied that that's not really how science works. We can say that there's a majority within a certain confidence interval, but we can't say 60% because that becomes so much more precise that we need to defend. It's especially difficult, I assumed, because there are just so many factors involved that we cannot even give a certain percentage.

At least, that's what I think. I've searched for a few papers in Pubmed with no avail, but perhaps the climate scientists on reddit can help point me to some other papers that may have that percentage of human influence... or concede that we cannot reach that ""ballpark percent."" Thanks for your time.

Edit: From another top-level [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/reo35/the_discussion_of_climate_change_is_so_poisoned/c45ciej) in a different thread,

&gt; Before the industrial age, we had 280 parts per million (ppm) of CO2. Afterwards, it became 390 ppm. We burned 500 billion metric tons of carbon in 150 years. Theoretically, burning that much would raise the atmospheric concentration to 500 ppm, but the ocean absorbs CO2 (110 ppm). We know that it's man-made because the isotope signature of the carbon matches.

It's probably not the best, but I suppose I could extrapolate and scientifically say that humans *caused* a 30% increase in CO2 levels which contributes to global warming because CO2 (and water vapor) absorbs infrared light.",2012-04-03,10:11:06,5,rr6gn

burning wood to create energy does not create global warming?,http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ssr8y/burning_wood_to_create_energy_does_not_create/,/r/askscience/comments/ssr8y/burning_wood_to_create_energy_does_not_create/,"I was watching a Feynman video on youtube where he was talking about fire..

he explains that trees take CO2 and break it into C and O2 with energy provided by the sun (by this point am assuming this is and Endothermic reaction). Then he later states that when you collide O2 with C again with enough energy they will reattach themselve creating CO2, and releasing the ""light"" (flames) or energy previously provided by the sun to break them appart in the first place.

So if trees take the CO2 in the air to grow, and then when they die (burn) they release that CO2 that was originally in the air back to the air again, burning woods to create energy would not create any surplus of CO2 in the atmosphere, thus not creating any global warming (I know am taking big leaps here).

Its all a balance of some sort I guess. If we (the planet) are a closed space (theres no CO2 getting in or out of the planet) and everything is balancing out, why do we have global warming? is the CO2 generated by burning oil not initially in the air?

How bad are the effects of global warming?,http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/twxc0/how_bad_are_the_effects_of_global_warming/,/r/askscience/comments/twxc0/how_bad_are_the_effects_of_global_warming/,"In my understanding the earth getting hotter due to man made influences is based on extremely uncontroversial science. The green house effect and carbon dioxide as a product of combustion have been known for upwards of one hundred years and from there it is a matter of plugging in how much we have burned since we started exploiting fossils fuels in earnest. True, there are other factors like ocean and plant absorption of carbon dioxide, but the default position ought to be Earth getting hotter.

What seems far less obvious to me is the risks this poses for humanity. First, let me get my moral point of view out of the way. I don't think we have an obligation to prioritize one ecosystem over another nor do extend moral standing to animals. So focusing in only on how global warming can hurt human survival and civilisation.

The concentration of carbon dioxide has been higher on the past, so it is clearly possible for complex life to exist at such concentrations and temperatures. Does the short time in which the change takes place make it a lot less likely for life to adapt? Further, are there any benefits to higher global temperatures? Could it open up Antarctica, Greenland and Northern Canada to agriculture and denser habitation? Also would melted icecaps lead to less variation in global temperatures or again does the rapid rate of warming throw this off?",2012-05-20,22:56:31,3,twxc0

[Mother Jones](http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2009/10/more-chamber-commerces-climate-denial) reports that the Chamber of Commerce says that global warming may be more beneficial too-- more people die from freezing then overheating worldwide. Countless CATO thinker-tankers and right-wingers who don't want to deny science, but don't want government regulation are all over the issue, too.

I'm skeptical... but is there any peer-reviewed science about the net effects of global warming? They make several claims:

* ""More evaporation will mean more net rainfall which means more crops/water/etc."" Is that correlation really there? Might some of the water just... stay up there? 
* "" Scientists say that global warming will open new areas for agriculture. It is predicted that global warming will increase the cultivable land in Canada, Europe, and the United States"" Which scientists are predicting this?
* ""Every year, many people are killed in the winter due to cold spells. Global warming can warm up the earth and reduce the number of cold spells, thereby, protecting several people from cold-induced deaths"" Are the leading theories about GW advocating expanded heat everywhere? I thought the temperature effects would vary across the surface of the planet.

-CO2 is a not bad for the environment.  In fact since plant life needs CO2 it is beneficial to the environment.  

-The sun is the reason for this recent rise in temperature not an increase in greenhouse gas.  He mentioned that this is happening to the entire solar system.

For example, he does not believe in global warming.  He says it is a normal cycle in the history of the world.

He backs this up by talking about volcanoes and their carbon dioxide.  Apparently, when a volcano set off a couple years ago, they measured the CO2 in the atmosphere and saw that it was almost 400% higher than it was used to.  (I'm not sure if it was 400%, I'm just repeating what he told us.)  Now, he says that if people are worrying about global warming - then why did the CO2 in the atmosphere have no ill effects?  He then says that the CO2 went back down to 'normal levels' in a short amount of time.  So, that means that if the earth was really bogged down with all this carbon dioxide that we humans are making, it could easily stop it and reverse it.

Now, my teacher is persuasive and well spoken.  He did convince a lot of people in my class, and even made me doubt my beliefs.

Please tell me where I am wrong because I realized this is what I have believed for about 4 years, and have never bothered to look into it.

My understanding is that Climate Change is happening, and also should be happening more than it actually appears to be (more on that in a bit). Humans are pumping CO2 into the atmosphere, and while that CO2 is a limited amount when compared to all the CO2 in the atmosphere naturally, the human amount is unnatural and ""builds up"", meaning the earth does not process it as well as it would if we weren't adding it. In other words, there is more CO2 each and every year, an excess amount if you will, building up from human activity. 

This CO2 in of itself doesn't really matter, as alone it would only warm the earth minimally over centuries. The real problem is feedback. Increased CO2 is merely a catalyst that causes the earth to retain more water vapor. It also melts Ancient ice releasing methane. This vapor and methane will have a warming impact two to four times that of CO2. The consensus in the scientific community is that this should occur, the feedback should be positive, and the earth will warm.

What we have seen since 1998 is a plateau in global temperatures. Though CO2's impact on the atmosphere is logarithmic, we ourselves increase the output of CO2 so rapidly that impact is almost linear if measured in any 10 year period,  and With positive feedback, it is nearly above linear. (meaning that from 2000-2012, we did as much damage as from 1988-2000 simply because we pumped out way more CO2.) This plateau in temperatures is caused by something. A cooling pattern, low solar activity, etc. etc. The point being, that once this cooling phases ends, we should begin to see temperatures rise fairly linearly. In fact, there should be a spike in temperature following the end of whatever is causing this current cooling period. (say .04 degrees celsius) that is at least measurable even over a short time frame. (say the 8 years that follow the end of the cooling period.)

So for anyone who argues that feedback is negative or neutral, there hope is that in fifteen years or so, temperatures will still not have risen, meaning that the earth has ""maxed out"" and CO2 and found magical a way to compensate through increased plant life or hot earth blocking out heat from the sun etc. In reality however, we should start to see warming again soon.

How accurate is this?

As a result, I know very little of the science itself. I know the basic gist of it (carbon emissions, shrinking ozone layer, melting ice caps, oceans rising, extreme weather) and everyone I know who is educated on the matter tells me to believe it.

What I wonder is if there are any legitimate scientists who believe global warming is false. Some people (the crazies) would have us believe that there is a serious scientific debate as to the validity of evolution, which is not the case. Does the same go for global warming, or is there actual dissent?",2012-07-27,19:36:57,1,x9viy

TL;DR: Sulfur dioxide is regularly emitted by coal-burning power plants into the lowest levels of the atmosphere. But occasionally, when there's a volcanic eruption, some sulfur dioxide makes its way into the stratosphere, where it reflects some sunlight away from the earth for a short time. If we were to strategically release some sulfur dioxide of our own into the stratosphere, rather than waiting for volcanic eruptions to do it for us, could this be a last-resort option for halting the escalation of global warming? Unintended consequences are a big concern, but advocates say that the process could be easily stopped if needed, and the sulfur dioxide dissipated relatively quickly.",2012-09-12,12:20:11,3,zrsp5

That's gradual isn't it?  People can either see the sea getting closer every year and move, or if they want to stay where they are so bad, they can build sea-walls or whatever.   Rivers and coast-lines have moved throughout history and people have had to move.

Or the rising temperature and crops - if it gets hotter up in northern latitudes can't you just grow the varieties that were being grown further south up north, if the heat is bad for northerly varieties?

Or desertification, the Sahara didn't used to be a desert, now it is.  If some places become deserts, then people will have to move, or try to prevent desertification.

So, that's the gist of my question - I always see people talk about Global Warming as a threat to humanity, like our survival as a species, and I don't see it.  What am I missing?  Sure, it'd suck to be living a place that goes underwater/becomes a desert, and you'll have refugee crises/famine/disease, but would the scale really be any larger than modern refugee crises/famines/disease outbreaks given that the timescale is in decades?  

Moreover, those seem like 'third world problems' - what threat does GW present to a first world country like the US that presumably has the ability to prevent things like desertification, build sea-walls, import heat-resistant varieties of crops/genetically engineer new ones?

This question is entirely related to the topic of environmental biotechnology (EB).

My question is, **with such a large emphasis placed on the impending threat of global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions, have there been any advances in the use of microorganisms to reduce these emissions/make them less harmful? Why aren't they being more heavily utilized?**

Any helpful insight on this topic, or links to research studies/experimental data pertaining to my question would be extremely appreciated.

2). The use of solar energy would clearly reduce our requirements on fossil fuel, thereby decreasing the output of greenhouse gasses.

It seems to me that this is indisputable proof of global warming? Why, beyond the obvious fact that there's a long trend here? Because of the math. If global warming were not happening, the the odds of 332 consecutive months of above average temperature would be 2^332, would they not? This ridiculously large number is just under 9 with 99 zeroes behind it. In other words, it's almost equal to one Googol.

**To put that in perspective, it's approximately one billion times larger than the total number of protons, neutrons and electrons in the universe**.

Is there anything wrong with my logic here? **It seems to me that, if you don't believe in global warming, you don't believe in math.** However, I am not a scientist, so I am very open to the possibility that my approach to understanding this issue is somehow off the mark.

"[Engineering]  For global warming instead of dealing with average earth temperature, can we just focus on the surface temperature?",http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/18zdn0/engineering_for_global_warming_instead_of_dealing/,/r/askscience/comments/18zdn0/engineering_for_global_warming_instead_of_dealing/,"I read an article on ebsco talking about the drawbacks and benefits of different green energy sources.  They mentioned harnessing wind power from the jet streams higher up in earths atmosphere and how it won't have much of an effect on the global temperature but can lower the surface temp up to 10 degrees C.  Here is the part:

'When we talk of extracting wind energy, it's mainly from wind at an altitude of about 100 metres. But wind speeds increase the higher you go. In the four jet streams that circle Earth more than 10 kilometres up, wind speeds of well over 100 kilometres per hour are typical.

Exploiting this energy will not be easy, not least because of the way the jet streams meander and change location, but several groups are developing ways to do it. Most involve tethered turbines or kites that turn generators on the ground .

According to some estimates, the available energy in the jet streams is about 100 times the current global energy demand. Simulations by Cristina Archer at the University of Delaware in Newark and Ken Caldeira of Stanford University in California suggest that extracting enough energy from high-level winds to meet all our current energy demands would have no significant impact on global climate. But their model suggests that extracting larger amounts would have a big impact. In the extreme case of extracting 1000 TW, mean surface temperatures fell nearly 10 Â°C, total rainfall decreased by about 35 per cent and sea ice cover doubled (Energies, vol 2, p 307).

The reason, says Caldeira, is that slowing down the high-altitude winds would slow the heat transfer between the equator and the poles. This would cause the equator to warm and the poles to cool, increasing sea ice cover. More sea ice means more heat is reflected from the poles. The end result is that the equator warms slightly, but the poles cool significantly.

This effect might actually be desirable to counteract global warming, given that the Arctic is warming faster than any other area on Earth and losing sea ice fast. So could we deliberately induce it? ""This is one of the things we plan to look at in the future,"" says Caldeira.""

"Two Part: 1st - Which produces more carbon - car or bicycle rider - and what is the difference in the carbon that is emitted and possible impact to global warming? 2nd - What has the highest impact of road stress/damage (weight, contact area, total force applied to road, points of contact, speeds)?",http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/19n5xi/two_part_1st_which_produces_more_carbon_car_or/,/r/askscience/comments/19n5xi/two_part_1st_which_produces_more_carbon_car_or/,"This [blog post](http://seattlebikeblog.com/2013/03/02/state-lawmaker-says-bicycling-is-not-good-for-the-environment-should-be-taxed/) got me thinking (for a TL:DR, there's a congressman who argues that cyclists are causing more impact on the environment due to their increased CO2 output and are damaging the roads and should be taxed proportionally). 

First, is there any real difference on the carbon emissions between the car and the human riding a bicycle (quantity/quality/impact to environment etc.)? 

2nd, for the road stress, I found one [article](http://archive.gao.gov/f0302/109884.pdf) descibing damage with extra axles of vehicles, but not sure if this is even useable for a comparison between a car and a bike rider. Things I thought could possibly impact would be weight, contact area, total force applied, # of points of contact, speeds.

Back of the envelope calc for total force applied to the road shows that a bicycle rider applies more force:

250 lb rider/bike with ~4in2 (1 inch x 1 inch x 2 tires) of contact = 62.5 psi 4000 lb car with ~144 in2 (6 inch x 6 inch x 4 tires) = 27.8 psi

I could see the congressman arguing that the increased force applied does more damage. I found one article talking about excessive truck weight having a larger impact than cars.

I don't want this to turn into anything political (whether or not there should be a tax), but just wanted to figure out if there's any truth to the increased CO2 emissions statement and then what type of damage a bicycle causes to roads compared to cars.

For one, I am in my uni's second-semester general &amp; descriptive chemistry class.  We just finished a unit on thermodynamics, including the ideal gas law, and changes in energy, heat, work, and entropy when gasses expand under different conditions.  I know from a meteorology class last semester that weather results from air parcels behaving adiabatically, but does heating the atmosphere as a whole work as a constant volume process?  Or is it adiabatic?  What are the other physical and chemical factors involved?

I'm also in a historical geology class, and one of the main points they are driving home is the sequence of transgression and regression of sea level.  I am wondering if increased sea-level pressure from periods of relative atmospheric &amp; oceanic warmth correspond with these periods of sea level change.

He was arguing that CO2 wasn't the main culprit in global warming. The source seems pretty legitimate. I was just wanting somebody to explain in fairly simple terms why this is or is not correct. Thanks.

 ""Here goes: The unpolluted atmosphere is transparent in the spectral region of lambda=8-12micrometers. So any effective greenhouse gas that absorbs radiation at lambda=8-12 micrometers is a highly effective GH gas. It is called the atmospheric ""window"" per say. Hope you are following me so far idiot. Anyways, CO2 absorbs wavelengths from 13-17 micrometers..waayyy out of our atmospheric window. Now CO2 is a greenhouse gas on Venus because its atmospheric window is in that wavelength. Here on Earth, the Suns photons become weaker, thus making our atmospheric window lower than that of Venus.

Here is the fun part, CFC's which have been destroying our ozone layer DO contribute to ""global warming"". They absorb a wavelength of 8-10, 11-12 micrometers. Enough CFCs in our atmosphere will cause global warming, no doubt. But the Ozone layer is repairing itself, ergo our cfc output is becoming smaller.

Huge amounts of systems are chaotic (one of the most simple examples is three planets rotating around each other), which by definition means that the slightest change in initial conditions gives unpredictable behavior.

Now the environment is a chaotic system. As there are so many things interacting with each other it is impossible for us to model it accurately, and therefore impossible to predict future behavior.

So when scientists say that increased CO2 will lead to higher global temperatures, are they assuming that the earth is a simple linear system? Or have they taken the fact the environment is chaotic into account? And if so, how?

To clarify i'm not a 'climate denier' or anything like that, but noone has given me a good answer to this question yet

&gt;Ostro began noticing a pattern of what's called increasing atmospheric *thickness*. In other words, the vertical distance between the Earth's surface and various higher levels of the atmosphere (identified by their atmospheric pressure) was growing. 

&gt;With increasing heat, the atmospheric ridges of high pressure (regions in which air is falling, rather than rising) were higher, taller, on average. ""The frequency of these really strong ridges of high pressure aloft, these anomalous high pressures aloft are increasing,"" Ostro explainsâ€”with profound consequences.

&gt;Strong high pressure ridges are tough to alter. They're persistent, and so is the weather that accompanies them. It could be a long heat wave; or it could be rain or snow for days on end. ""The crazy snow in China, the cold in parts of Europe and Asia this winter, and extreme flooding, and heat waves, it's driving all of that,"" Ostro says. The outcomes are variableâ€”but the extremes are often powerful enough to have dramatic consequences in terms of human lives and also economic losses.

Imagine we have unfettered ""Mister Fusion"" type energy production in every home that can turn waste matter into pure energy. Would converting ""waste mass"" into pure energy release way too much heat energy into earth's (semi?) closed system?

Would it be global warming - but instead of releasing CO2 - we'd be increasing heat on the globe at a far greater rate than earth would radiate?

It seems to me it's as if suddenly all matter would be a ""fossil fuel"": ie ""stored energy in the earth"".. and that is even disregarding how willy-nilly we could use this excess energy heating and lighting every room.",2013-07-14,19:28:26,3,1iay5b

There has been a 5 foot drop since the 90s; and it is being attributed (in this article) to solar warming, and a lack of ice over the Lakes which allows it. As a result the water temperature is getting warmer even though air temperature isn't. 

* So in an extended view - what will happen to the great lakes? 

* What will happen with the polar ice caps melting? (The lakes are essentially large rivers, so would that increase the flow through?)

I live in an area very close to the Lakeshore on Lake Michigan and this is fascinating me - thanks in advance for the information!

The implication was that higher discount rates reduce the ""desirability"" of mitigation efforts, since the costs are immediate and the benefits take decades to arrive. This is certainly true at the margin, for the rate the Stern Review used (1.4% per year), but is it still true when much lower discount rates are considered? A lot of the negative effects of global warming that I've heard of involve having to adapt to disturbances (e.g. rising sea levels). With a discount rate of 0.1% per year (so that the year 2705 is valued more than half as much as 2013), how harmful would global warming be? Hundreds of years is more than enough time for people to move away from coasts, move into temperate areas, and generally move around a lot.

[This article](http://science.time.com/2014/01/06/climate-change-driving-cold-weather/?iid=obnetwork) from TIME argues that warm stratospheric air could be what threw the normal Arctic balance off, resulting in the polar vortex moving south. The article also mentions that the jet stream becoming weaker as a consequence of global warming could mean that more of the polar vortex ""spills"" southward.  However, the article also points out that the IPCC thinks that global warming means a diminished polar vortex.

I understand that it wouldn't cause a repeat of the Little Ice Age conditions of 1645-1715 (the duration of the Maunder Minimum), but *IF* I understand correctly (and it's possible I'm missing something), it seems like a repeat of the Maunder Minimum in the 21st century would have some downward pressure on the earth's temperature, right? If it has a downward pressure on temperature, how much? And would it take a measurable bite out of the projected ""business as usual"" temperature increase for this century? Or is the effect on global temperature negligible? 

Also, is it possible to adjust the 21st century ""business as usual"" warming projection in real numbers based on a repeat of the Maunder Minimum?

Now, the ocean contains around 60 times more CO2 than the atmosphere in various forms. But, if the temperature raises, according to the Le Chatelier's principle, the solubility of CO2 should decrease, thus releasing even more CO2 to the atmosphere, which, in turn, would enhance the green house effect. This should cause a positive feedback effect, and should heat the Earth even more.

Now, the question is why isn't it happening? And if does, how did the little ice age happen?

That being said, I am not a denier. I do not take a stand on this issue, I just have concerns. I am completely open to changing my opinion, but the implications of this issue are huge and would require a complete reordering of society so I think it is important to address the concerns of skeptics such as myself instead of casting us off as flat-earthers. I am not an expert, or I obviously would not be asking this question. I am not a scientist, but I am also not dumb (or so I would like to think). I am aware that the number of climate scientists who argue that we humans are having a massive impact on climate is overwhelming, but I do not think that this is reason enough to accept it because an overwhelming number of experts have been wrong about other issues in the past. So please, do not reply by simply saying ""All the scientists say its true so just get on board and believe them."" Here are the main points that I have questions about that fuel my skepticism:
1) What about the sun? I have seen studies correlating solar activity and global temperature that seem to show an extremely interesting correlation that is independent of human activity.
2) A close examination of many of the graphs (especially the infamous ""An Inconvenient Truth"" graph) linking temperature to CO2 in the atmosphere show that temperature rises before CO2 does, and when the temperature falls, CO2 continues to increase before falling. This suggests (to me in all my ignorance) that temperature effects atmospheric CO2, and not the other way around. This ties into my first question: If the sun is driving increases in temperature, then that increase in temperature would cause more CO2 in the atmosphere. I know this is simplistic, but that doesn't necessarily make it incorrect. Please, persuade me.
3) The ""Climate Gate"" Scandal. Was this just blown WAY out of proportion, because to a layman it seems to suggest a damning amount of collusion, suppression of legitimate counter-studies, and ideologically motivated science.
4) The correlation between ice caps on Earth and ice caps on Mars, as well as other planetary climate data that shows other planets are experiencing similar changes as Earth, suggesting further that there are forces other than atmospheric CO2 that are much more important factors.
I'm sure there are more concerns I could think of, but these are the main ones. Feel free to be firm, but please be nice.",2014-02-27,15:01:51,0,1z43bs

Climate change strikes me as different for several reasons. 1) Changes are created very slowly and long term effects become harder to notice. 2) The effects of a single cycle may occur over lengths of time much greater than the lifespan of a single human. 3) Exact, specific data regarding multiple whole cycles doesn't exist because we haven't (until fairly recently, on this timescale) had the tools to accurately measure whole cycles and record them for future use.

So, all that being considered, how do we **know** that the current rise in global temperature isn't a slowly evidenced natural response to the Little Ice Age, and in a lesser capacity, the Mount Tambora eruption in 1815 which led to the Year Without a Summer and world wide temperature drops of .4-.7 degrees C? (These are just two possible contributions in what I imagine must be a hugely complex system)

Anyway, my question regarding to what extent our surface infrastructure has played with climate change. If I was to compare a picture of the earth 100 years ago with one of today, I would see a certain percentage (any ideas on a number? .5%? 1%? 10?% my gut says something like 2% but thats just a guess) of the planet has been paved with roads, parking lots, rooftops, highways, parks, forests ( and deforests), ect. This changes the overall albedo of the planet and I was wondering what the current discussions are about these changes and their impact on climate change. I would think that any change in the amount of light reflected back out into the space would add to or take away (in the case of higher reflectivity) from the overall heat of the atmosphere. I looked up the [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo#Human_activities) and it was delightlfully useless.",2014-04-07,17:33:00,2,22glbg

I have heard the proposal to increase cloud cover by whatever percentage to reflect heat. Energy Secretary Chu proposed making roofs white for the same reason. Would cloud seeding be a cost-effective means of counter-acting the increased greenhouse effect from CO2 emissions? Considering $billions has been spent along the the lines of combating climate change already, I can't imagine the costs are out of the question, so long as the temperature changes could be significant enough.

So I guess I'm asking two questions: Can cloud seeding possibly lower global temperatures significantly enough to be worth doing? If so, is it relatively cost effective?",2014-04-08,12:44:01,5,22j1cm

Here's how my logic flows:

Microwaves use radio waves similiar to broadcast TV, in an enclosed space, to heat up the water in our food, drinks, etc. The waves bounce off the walls and so they are focused in the area of the microwave. 

We are using many different bands of radio waves for many purposes. TV, Cellphones, CB radios, etc. So essentially we are filling our air with radio waves. I scale out to imagine the entire Earth as the ""microwave"". The ""walls"" would be the satellites continually bouncing the waves back to us instead of letting them escape into space, as well as the other natural materials acting as boundaries. 

Is there simply too much air to be heated up by our collective uses of radio waves? Are our waves just not powerful enough for it to be an issue? Or are we slowly heating the air with increasing use of radio waves and cooking ourselves like a microwave? I'm no scientist, be gentle.

Per [this](https://www.americanforests.org/assumptions-and-sources/#carbon) link:

&gt; American Forests has estimated that our tree planting projects average 450 trees per acre, which leaves us with one final calculation:

&gt; 410060 pounds of CO2/450 trees per acre = ~911 pounds of CO2 sequestered per tree planted

and [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions):

&gt; Annual global CO^2 emissions in thousands of tons: 31,350,455

I've converted this to 31,350,455,000 tons, and ~2 trees per ton, for 62,700,910,000 trees needed.

Then I divided by 450 trees /acre for 139335355.55 acres.

Then I used an [acres to square kilometers conversion calculater](http://www.metric-conversions.org/area/acres-to-square-miles.htm)

I get 563,870 square km.

Even if you presume that my numbers or sources are overly optimistic, wouldn't it be trivial for the civilized world to increase the forest area on the planet by one or two million square kilometers?",2014-05-02,17:40:46,9,24kqeu

I know that in the ocean, more evaporation happens and on land there is more precipitation. If there will be more water in the ocean wouldnt that mean more water would be evaporated and there would be more rain on land? Areas lacking rain (say a desert) would get more rain. 

In addition, would that water fill any underwater caves or aquifers, essentially holes in the ground? 

This thought occured to me because news report and my college professors are saying we are lacking water.

Would this cause less impact by rising seal levels? Maybe cause more rainfall? I mean based on my limited understanding I would think that this would cause more rainfall, and lead to there being more fresh water available on land. I'm thinking that even if the planet got hotter the water that evaporates would still eventually become rain, maybe it would need to get to a higher elevation to condense, wouldn't that cause a higher percentage of the over all water on the planet to be in the atmosphere at any given time? Is this something that is considered in the models scientists you to predict the future effects concerning the rise in average temperature of the planet, or am I just totally off base here?

Why not find the next 'ready-to-blow' volcano, use a bunch of conventional explosives to set it off, and let the ensuing fallout work to cool the earth? Specific questions I have:

**Location**: How important is the location of the volcano? Would it need to be in a specific area on the Earth taking into account the prevailing winds, bodies of water affected, etc?

**Size**: Is there too fine a line between an eruption being big enough to influence global climate, and being small enough to avoid an extinction level event? Too much guesswork involved?

**Viability**: Is it even possible to force a volcanic eruption in such a way to produced the desired affect?

**Sustained Results**: Assuming all the above issues are resolved and the perfect eruption scenario, would it provide any kind of worth-while results. Would it provide temporary (relative) relief, or a lasting effect?

Pretty basic physics.

I started to think about how much stuff we put in our oceans (boats, subs, oil rigs...) that contribute to rising water levels. Just as an example I looked into aircraft carriers. The US has 10 active Nimitz-class carriers that displace at least 100,000 long tons each (224,000,000 pounds each). That means that all 10 ships together displace 2,240,000,000 pounds of water.

It was always ""I have looked at the evidence and in my opinion it indicates that there is a trend towards global warming,"" or ""I have seen a lot of information and evidence, but I don't think it indicates a long term trend, just typical temporary trends in raise or reduction of global temperature."" Of course I'm talking about the scientific videos and articles not the tinfoil hatters who have been convinced one way or another for a very long time, but the point is that it was hotly debated and you would be laughed at for pretending that it is confirmed one way or another, as the data was more or less open to interpretation. 

Yet for what to me seems like no apparent reason, apparently long term climate change has been confirmed or at least determined beyond reasonable doubt, and people get called out and laughed at for denying climate change, in a similar way that creationists always get called out for denying that the earth is round or claiming that the earth is 6000 years old or whatever shit they tend to spew.

The government of the U.S. even officially stated that it is a serious and real issue that they have to do something about and start planning long term.

Bear with me, as I'm grossly ignorant of climate science. In effort to bone up on these issues I've been doing some reading over the past few days. One popular fact that I've come across is that we passed 400 ppm CO2 for the first time in human history. To measure atmospheric CO2 scientists have been using data analyzers on Mauna Loa. This practice has been done since 1958. Prior to 1958, our measurements for atmospheric CO2 came from ice core data. 

I understand the practical reasons for this. (1. We can't go back in time to measure CO2 levels using these analyzers. 2. Ice core data aren't as reliable for measuring current levels of atmospheric CO2.)

However, it seems to me that by using two different measurement methods, one could fairly easily misapply or misinterpret the results of the data. 

Indeed, the exponential rise in atmospheric CO2 appears to coincide with the use of Mauna Loa data, as shown in the following graphs [Graph 1](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/wp-content/plugins/sio-bluemoon/graphs/co2_800k_zoom.png) [Graph 2] (https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/wp-content/plugins/sio-bluemoon/graphs/co2_800k.png)

Can someone address my concern? [Here](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/2014/03/20/how-are-ice-core-data-and-mauna-loa-atmospheric-data-made-comparable/) is Scripps answer on their website, which addresses the question, albeit somewhat superficially.

Reports from that page, and others on the site, show examples of farm lands increasing their organic matter concentrations 2x-3x that amount in a matter of years. Is it realistic to think that we could lower atmospheric carbon concentrations by that much through this process?

The authors investigated the greenhouse effect of methane and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere using their tested adiabatic model, which relates the global temperature of troposphere to the atmospheric pressure and solar activity. This model allows one to analyze the global temperature changes due to variations in mass and chemical composition of the atmosphere. Even significant releases of anthropogenic carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere do not change average parameters of the Earth’s heat regime and have no essential effect on the Earth’s climate. Thus, petroleum production and other anthropogenic activities resulting in accumulation of additional amounts of methane and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have practically no effect on the Earth’s climate.

* N2O is 310 times as powerful a greenhouse gas as CO2 and it stays in the atmosphere for over a hundred years.

I don't deny global warming, but I think it could work out to our advantage. 

For a decent part of Earth's history, plants have been evolving in an environment where they had more CO2 in the air, and have been steadily trapping it within the soil as complex compounds. We are now releasing the trapped carbon back into the air due to which it's getting a bit warmer. But it's on record that the poles were a lot warmer than they are now overall.

So though the climate may get warmer, it may not be difficult to adapt and may even open up new possibilities that we hadn't thought of.

We talked about CO2 and its cycle. How were releasing it how the earth both releases it and absorbs it. Talked about greenhouse gasses and all kinds of other stuff. I had him watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDRnH48LvhQ) and click back and forth from the start and end to get an idea of how much ice is gone and what that means. How ice/snow reflect sunlight and so forth.

Well he asked and I think he was referring to the Nasa link I gave him. How do we know that CO2 hasn't risen above that in all these years before we were around to record data? So it got me thinking. How do we know any of it before even say 1700? I can't find much on it, soil samples, ice core samples. That goes back 600,000 years?

I need more information on this!

It was left with the following explanation


&gt;There was nothing special about the temperature of the Earth in 2014. In fact, there has been no meaningful warming since last century.
This is true no matter what set of temperature data you examine.
Share the facts at CFACT.org: http://www.cfact.org/?p=24141

&gt;However, when you examine the data recorded from satellites, the flaws in the warming narrative become even clearer.

&gt;However, when you examine the data recorded from satellites, the flaws in the warming narrative become even clearer.

&gt;Satellites are considered by many to be the best available source of temperature data. Local measurements are subject to many sorts of errors. Temperature stations tend to be located near population centers where they are subject to the urban heat island effect. Weather balloons, temperature stations and buoys leave huge gaps in coverage. Climate researchers then fill in the their best guesses as to what temperature should be for the huge areas where no readings exist. This creates opportunity for honest error — or worse.

&gt;Satellites, on the other hand, record temperatures over the entire Earth. Their coverage is more complete and the data they yield is much more difficult to manipulate.

&gt;Go ahead, examine the data for yourself. Compare it to the computer model projections.

&gt;That’s what the warming crowd fears most.",2015-02-09,22:31:58,18,2vdnk5

What I don't know is how bad I should expect it to be assuming little or nothing is done. What bad outcomes would we be mitigating/avoiding by tackling greenhouse gas emissions.

I heard people say they believe that the warming is slower than expected, that we have lots of time to tackle it, and that even if we did nothing won't start seeing serious negative effects for close to a century. I've also heard some say that we've already passed the point of no return where nothing we do will matter, and that while humanity won't go extinct, essentially we're going to start seeing a lot of the negative effects soon, like in 20 years, and with positive feedback loops we're screwed. I've also seen a lot in the middle.

I mean, you could say that the model was off by .2 degrees, but exactly how big is that error? 

Obviously, the further out from the present you try to predict, the more likelihood for error there will be so I assume that should be included. Another factor of time is the models themselves.  I assume that our models have improved over time so is it possible to quantify the increased precision over time? ",2015-03-30,11:32:32,2,30tcz4

It then stands to reason that if we can cut our greenhouse gas emissions by a significant margin then we can prevent or, at the very least, mitigate the effects of climate change.

This is all well and good for developed nations (which are comprised of roughly 1.2 billion people) who have the money, the technology, and the societal cohesion to move away from fossil fuels and rely on more complicated and expensive energy sources. 

The developing world, which consists of an estimated 5.9 billion people, does not have these luxuries. Most developing nations need a cheap source of energy so that they can establish industry and raise their standards of living. Fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas, and coal fit their needs perfectly. These countries simply do not have the money to build expensive wind farms, the know-how to develop efficient nuclear reactors (like we would even allow them to build them in the first place), nor the resources to build solar panels.

What are we to do? On one hand we cannot allow the unrestricted burning of fossil fuels to continue without facing catastrophic consequences.
On the other hand would we not be damning roughly 6 billion people to live in sub-par living conditions because the most reasonable path out of such conditions is now blocked by international law.

For example this quote from Al Gore In his Dec. 10, 2007 Nobel Prize speech, Gore said “Last September 21, as the Northern Hemisphere tilted away from the sun, scientists reported with unprecedented distress that the North Polar ice cap is ""falling off a cliff."" One study estimated that it could be completely gone during summer in less than 22 years. Another new study, to be presented by U.S. Navy researchers later this week, warns it could happen in as little as 7 years.” 

This article claims the NASA polar ice data shows no melt in the last 35 years. It says the ice has actually grown. 

http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamestaylor/2015/05/19/updated-nasa-data-polar-ice-not-receding-after-all/

There are now at least 10 other articles like the one below citing this data. They are usually from climate change deniers. 

http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/05/24/global-warming-continues-to-pummel-polar-ice-caps-by-not-causing-them-to-melt-n2003328

I have not been able to find a counter argument to this data other than people trying to discredit Forbes and the author. I have not found a counter article based on the facts of the NASA data.

I'd like to help the cause in educating the uninformed to the best of my ability using well-researched and complete information, rather than something that skews the data to suit their hypothesis.

Also, doesn't the fact that the data is from Jan 2005 to May 2015 make the data meaningless?

People are actually defending the man who made the claims, and trying to say that he was taken out of context (because he was using a hypothetical based on someone else's report), **or that what he is saying is actually a real effect.** 

There are several THOUSAND upvotes for posts claiming that his claim was somewhat accurate, and that heat could be built up from slowing the wind. Nearly all the leading posts say that his claims were ""somewhat true"" or ""not completely false""

https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/3ccgys/bill_nye_is_not_impressed/

So, how many windmills would it take to increase the earth's temperature as much as greenhouse gas emissions have done? It is even physically possible for windmills to create that kind of disturbance at ANY amount? 

And yes, I do believe this requires an answer, seeing as how so many people seem to believe that windmills can have devastating environmental effects somehow. 

Is it possible for windmills to have even remotely the effect on the environment as forms of power that produce greenhouse gases?

"Climate change, deforestation and the slight cooling effect. Is it for real?",http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3fw18b/climate_change_deforestation_and_the_slight/,/r/askscience/comments/3fw18b/climate_change_deforestation_and_the_slight/,"**Preface:** For most of my life I've been a city-dweller, with little experience of ""nature"" aside from of a few days in state or national parks. I believe global climate change is real. I am a scientist by training and vocation (technically, I'm a manger now), but not in the area of climate change.

**Background:**A few months ago I came across [this infographic on climate change](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/). I think it's a fascinating and well-presented view of the contributions to global climate change.

One of the charts in the infographic has to do with deforestation. As a city-dweller, the explanation given makes sense to me, or at least it did:
*""Dark forests are yielding to lighter patches, which reflect more sunlight - and have a slight cooling effect.""*

**The problem:** This summer I've had the opportunity to spend much more time ""in nature"", in a variety of locations, and it has started to challenge my understanding as to what is really going on with deforestation.

In things like cornfields, which are dark and massive, my subjective experience has been that they hold heat and humidity exceptionally well - better than gravel or concrete parking lots, especially a few hours after sunset. Within a cornfield, the mass of water in the air alone is enough to retain heat on that plot of land; it's a crazy effect. During a hot day a cornfield is insufferable from both heat and humidity, and even at night it is markedly warmer, which seems to confirm the idea that light spots hold less heat than the dark spots.

However, my experience with forests is completely different. Despite the fact that many forested areas have green canopies that are darker (in most cases) than a cornfield, the soil temperature, air temperature, and humidity within a North American forest is degrees cooler than the surrounding plains and parking lots. In fact, it is common to be sitting in the parking lot and have the wind shift so that it's coming through the forest, which makes the breeze markedly cooler. Additionally, even 6 hours after sunset the heat island effect causes a white concrete parking lot to stay warm, but the forest is even cooler - which directly contradicts the deforestation claim in the infographic. This phenomenon was so profound that I even started measuring it (though unscientifically - I didn't have the right equipment with me). Plus, I couldn't get on top of the canopy, though I was able to do some measurements over a forested canyon, which confirmed that the air temp over the forest was lower than, say, a light gravel parking lot.

Additionally, I commented on this effect to the old-timers in the area, and they looked at me like I was crazy, saying that the woods is always cooler in summer. After some thought, it seems to me that the absorption of solar energy by chloroplasts might not be accounted for in the deforestation claims. Might the autotrophic nature of the plants be utilizing the solar energy in a way that reduces the overall heating effect? Dark might mean more heat absorption in the strictest sense, but in the case of forests, the dark coloring is supporting a work and energy storage mechanism that results in heat not being radiated back off into the atmosphere, unlike, say, a dark asphalt parking lot, which is simply a heat sink.

Overall, I'm struggling with my subjective experience and rudimentary measurements vs the data I've seen. Additionally, I think I have a semi-plausible hypothesis as to why my experiences might be real. Can anyone shed light on my experience vs the claims in the infographic I linked? What is actually going on with deforestation?",2015-08-05,12:07:14,5,3fw18b

I am expecting that Carbon ppm is not the only factor that will determine the environment and climate change however I am trying to be able to fully grasp this value to something I can visualize or understand. At this moment I see that this value is increasing fast however I have no concept of application or impact of the number.

We are currently at 401 Carbon ppm via Nasa. So Im wondering; 
&amp;nbsp;

What type of effect does 100 Carbon ppm have on our environment ?

&amp;nbsp;

What would 1000 Carbon ppm look like ? (any arbitrary increase)

&amp;nbsp;

Historically how has the trend of increasing 401 carbon ppm shown to increase the global temperature? 

&amp;nbsp;

What type of environment and consequences occur at each stage of increasing carbon? 

&amp;nbsp;

What Carbon ppm would make earth uninhabitable? Assuming we do not change the circumstances of our survival ( Living underwater, creating domes of isolated inhabitable environments ,etc ) and live as we do now.

&amp;nbsp;


Also kind of related, I have read ( unsure whether or not this statement is correct) that 190 carbon ppm is one of the largest factors that changed the climate to end the ice age. How much of a temperature increase is 190 carbon ppm responsible for causing ? ( This is me assuming that temperature is the reason why the ice  age end and the ice melted, If Im wrong please correct me ) ",2015-12-12,13:30:10,1,3wjjn6

I know this is reddit so this is probably sacrilegious, but I was hoping for an honest answer because this is something I've always wondered about. CFCs last about 1000x longer in the atmosphere than CO2, and has a global warming potential 5700x that of CO2. Are other greenhouse gases accounted for in global warming studies that compare CO2 levels and global temperatures?

I may have just learned the wrong thing early on and never looked back.  Here's how I understand greenhouse gases.  Let's think about combustion in its simplest form: coal combustion.  C (s) + O2 (g) -&gt; CO2 (g).  The gas we started with was O2, and we exchanged one O2 mole for one CO2 mole.  I always just assumed that CO2 must have a lower heat capacity than O2.  Therefore, when the sun's (relatively constant) energy hits a mole of CO2, it is able to warm it up more than it would be able to warm up the mole of O2 that existed before.  Hence, the temperature rises.  After looking at a heat capacity table, a mole of CO2 has a higher heat capacity than a mole of O2, so this turns my whole understanding upside down.  Does a gas' quality of being a greenhouse gas have anything to do with its heat capacity, or are they completely unrelated qualities? ",2016-03-10,16:52:23,4,49vp3p

http://m.imgur.com/vSJnLVe

Added: Most graphs found ONLY show the man-made contributions and gases like CO2, which when looked at alone, does seem alarming. But if water vapor really does comprise the vast majority of the greenhouse effect, obviously it should be taken into consideration as well, I would think.

To begin with, I very much understand the impact that our civilization is having on our planet's climate.  

If I understand correctly, our star (like most others in it's class) is slowly expanding and releasing more heat energy as it grows older and works its way to becoming a red giant. If that is an accurate observation on my part, who's to say that the Sun is not bombarding our planet with more and more solar radiation and heat as time passes, resulting in a warmer and warmer climate here on Earth? Is this process just on a much larger time scale than I'm imagining? Do we keep track of surface temperatures on other bodies in our solar system to monitor this effect?",2016-05-02,13:56:33,3,4hivdm

However, the [Younger Dryas wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas) puts forth five competing hypotheses, the most prominent of which still lacks sufficient evidence.

&gt;The prevailing theory is that the Younger Dryas was caused by significant reduction or shutdown of the North Atlantic ""Conveyor"", which circulates warm tropical waters northward, in response to a sudden influx of fresh water from Lake Agassiz and deglaciation in North America. Geological evidence for such an event is thus far lacking.

I do not have a science background whatsoever, so I often get stuck trying to regurgitate basic principles in climate change-- but would love some insight or a point-in-the-right-direction as to whether or not his claim is real or if it's just a strawman to delegitimize our insistence that global warming is a problem.

The article didn't explain figures like how much surface area of lake was releasing methane or an estimate of how many tonnes of methane would be released by these lakes. The comment section wasn't helpful either. Are there models on how methane releases like these affect climate change? Stories about methane sound scary, but there's a big difference between ""This is another 1 degree C increase by 2100"" and ""The runaway effects will mean at least 10 degree C increase by 2100"". 

I understand methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2, but I also understand methane has a much shorter lifetime in the atmosphere than CO2. From what I've read so far, these arctic methane releases are just ""the icing on the CO2 cake"". Apparently, it isn't too late to fight climate change.",2017-03-25,23:35:01,1,61jofb

But is it something we can realistically implement? Can it be done at a scale large enough that it would have an appreciable effect? Is there anyone doing notable R&amp;D on sequestration techniques?

Because we 'harvest' sunlight we collect energy. Devices that use energy, e.g. fridge, cars, cooking etc. etc. have to put that energy back out there, e.g. heat from airconditioning unit.

What is the amount of energy we take on extra because of this? Does it have an effect on global warming? And what is the net benefit compared to fossil fuels.

If we replace all fosil fuels with solar panels, how many solar panels would be needed to equal present day fossil fuel impact? 

What made me think; small room no people, temprature is balanced, add people and the temprature rises because of our internal 'combustion' engine. So this must count for a closed room, with glass windows with a heater running on electricity delivered to it by solar panels.",2016-12-15,05:13:32,5,5igs92

Basically, what are the current attempts to model Earth's climate that 1) correctly predict the Earth's prehistoric temperature record; 2) *don't* predict the current rise in temperatures without an artificial, human source of greenhouse gases; and 3) *do* predict the current rise in temperatures when you add an artificial, human source of greenhouse gases? (and thus show that the current trend can't be explained by any of the mechanisms that caused earlier shifts, but must be artificial)

Or, how close we are to such a model, or why such a model is unreasonable to ask for?

**Note:** I'm not asking whether the Earth is warming, or whether CO2 levels are rising, or whether humans are the cause of those. I realize the consensus is that these are true. I'm asking whether there are predicative models that show this, and for the mathematical details of such a model. (e.g. the climate equivalent of the [Langmuir-Hinshelwood model for catalysts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactions_on_surfaces#Langmuir.E2.80.93Hinshelwood_mechanism))
