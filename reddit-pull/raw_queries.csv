"We are Professor Tim Lenton and Dr Damien Mansell from the University of Exeter and we're about to launch our free global climate change course. Ask us anything about Climate Change, from challenges to solutions!","We are Professor Tim Lenton and Dr Damien Mansell from the University of Exeter and today we're joined by a few of our student facilitators to answer your questions about Climate Change. We've designed a free online course, '[Climate Change: Challenges and Solutions](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/climate-change-challenges-and-solutions)' to show you some of the science behind Climate Change, present the challenges and identify potential solutions to these global problems. Today we want to open this up to r/askscience, so please ask us anything about Climate Change!

Professor Tim Lenton is actively researching tipping points in the Earth system, especially the Climate system, and identifying early warning signs for them. He is also studying the revolutionary transformations of the Earth System, including the co-evolution of life and the planet. Dr Damien Mansell's principal research interests include the calving processes of tidewater-terminating glaciers, glacier surges, cryosphere instabilities and remote sensing for glaciological applications. His teaching specialises in GIS and remote sensing techniques and understanding the cryosphere.

We'll be on starting at 4pm UK time (11 AM ET)!

"AGU AMA: I’m Dr. Kim Cobb, and I’m here to talk about the science of climate change, El Niño, and the reconstruction of past climate. And I’m Dr. Anne Jefferson, and I’m here to talk about how water moves through landscapes and how land use and climate change alter hydrology. Ask Us Anything!","Hi Reddit! 


I am Kim Cobb, Professor and Georgia Power Scholar in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am also Editor of Geophysical Research Letters. My life’s work is dedicated to unlocking the patterns of past climate changes from corals and cave stalagmites, with a particular focus on El Niño. With the current record-breaking event still underway, it’s been a busy year full of field expeditions to my remote research sites. Together with my students, we’ve been able to uncover the first evidence that El Niño events may be strengthening in response to anthropogenic climate change. Most recently, I participated in an interdisciplinary expedition that documented extensive coral mortality on an island in the very middle of the Pacific. I enjoy tweeting at @coralsncaves, and blogging (infrequently) at http://cobblab.blogspot.com. In my spare time, I’m raising four children ages 5-8. You can view my lab web-page at http://shadow.eas.gatech.edu/~kcobb


I am Anne Jefferson, recently tenured faculty in the Department of Geology at Kent State University. I am also a AAAS Public Engagement Fellow. My research answers questions like “What happens to streams when climate changes from snow to rain in the winter?” and “How can we manage stormwater to mitigate the effects of urbanization and prepare for climate change?” and “Does stream restoration work?” I’ve studied water everywhere from groundwater deep below lava flows to the mighty Mississippi River, from green rooftops to the pipe network below our streets. I am a physical hydrologist and I spend a lot of time carefully measuring how much water there is, how it’s moving, where it has come from, and how old it is. I also I collaborate with scientists who study water quality, stream ecology, landscape architecture, and human institutions. Water is a very interdisciplinary subject!

"The discussion of climate change is so poisoned by politics that I just can't follow it. So r/askscience, I beg you, can you filter out the noise? What is the current scientific consensus on the concept of man-made climate change?","The only thing I know is that the data consistently suggest that climate change is occurring. However, the debate about whether *humans* are the cause (and whether we can do anything about it at this point) is something I can never find any good information about. What is the current consensus, and what data support this consensus?

Furthermore, what data do climate change deniers use to support their arguments? Is any of it sound?

====================

Right now the land and ocean (over time) absorb about half of all CO2 emissions. But it’s not yet clear if that will keep up! The upcoming UN climate talks in Paris will focus on levels of human-caused emissions. We are focused on the natural response to rising emissions and how we can learn more about it.

We’ll be online from 3-4 pm EST today to answer questions about what NASA is doing to better understand how land and ocean ecosystems are responding to a warming planet and rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere — and what these ecosystem changes could mean for future climate change. Ask Us Anything!

Hi everyone! I am Natassa Romanou, an oceanographer at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. I work with climate models and observations and I am specifically interested in how oceans change under climate change and conversely, how oceans affect the global carbon cycle and therefore the rate at which Earth’s climate is changing. I am also involved in the planning of a very exciting NASA field campaign, EXPORTS, that will investigate the changes in ecosystems and carbon stocks and fluxes in the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans.

Hello all – I am Jeff Masek, a research scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland.  My scientific focus has been on understanding forest dynamics &amp; their role in the terrestrial carbon cycle using long time series of satellite data.   I also serve as the NASA Project Scientist for the Landsat program, which provides much of our global information on land use and land cover changes.  

Hi everybody on line. I'm David Schimel, a carbon scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab. I look at how climate affects forest growth and loss using satellite and aircraft measurements an also measurements of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. I work on NASA’s new Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 mission that is giving us an entirely new way of understanding ecosystems and the carbon cycle.

"AskScience AMA Series: I spent the last year investigating the potential of carbon-capture technology (or ""clean coal"") to mitigate climate change. Ask me anything!","Under the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, the world has agreed to do what is needed to keep global temperatures from not rising above 2 degrees C as compared to pre-industrial levels. According to the International Panel on Climate Change, in every economically viable scenario to that goal, the world needs to deploy carbon-capture technologies on large scale.

These technologies allow us to keep burning fossil fuels almost without emissions, while putting us on the trajectory to hit our climate goals. They are considered a bridge to a future where we can create, store, and supply all the world's energy from renewable sources. But carbon-capture technologies have a tortured history. Though first developed nearly 50 years ago, their use in climate-change mitigation only began in earnest in the 1990s and scaling them up hasn't gone as planned. 

My initial perception, based on what I had read in the press, was that carbon capture seemed outrageously expensive, especially when renewable energy is starting to get cheap enough to compete with fossil fuels. At the same time, my training in chemical engineering and chemistry told me the technologies were scientifically sound. And some of world's most important bodies on climate change keep insisting that we need carbon capture. Who should I believe?

The question took me down a rabbit hole. After a year of reporting, I've come to a conclusion: Carbon capture is both vital and viable. I've ended up writing nearly 30,000 words in The Race to Zero Emissions series for Quartz. 

You can read the 8,000-word story where I lay the case for the technology here: https://qz.com/1144298; other stories from the series here: https://qz.com/re/the-race-to-zero-emissions/; and follow the newsletter here: https://bit.ly/RacetoZeroEmissions.

AskScience AMA Series: We are climate scientists here to talk about the important individual choices you can make to help mitigate climate change. Ask us anything!,"Hi! We are Seth Wynes and Kimberly Nicholas, authors of a recent scientific study that found the four most important choices individuals in industrialized countries can make for the climate are not being talked about by governments and science textbooks. We are joined by Kate Baggaley, a science journalist who wrote about in [this story](http://nbcnews.to/2AjqKSL)

Individual decisions have a huge influence on the amount of greenhouse gas released into the atmosphere, and thus the pace of climate change. Our research of global sustainability in Canada and Sweden, compares how effective 31 lifestyle choices are at reducing emission of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases. The decisions include everything from recycling and dry-hanging clothes, to changing to a plant-based diet and having one fewer child.
 
The findings show that many of the most commonly adopted strategies are far less effective than the ones we don't ordinarily hear about. Namely, having one fewer child, which would result in an average of 58.6 metric tons of CO2-equivalent (tCO2e) emission reductions for developed countries per year. The next most effective items on the list are living car-free (2.4 tCO2e per year), avoiding air travel (1.6 tCO2e per year) and eating a plant-based diet (0.8 tCO2e per year). Commonly mentioned actions like recycling are much less effective (0.2 tCO2e per year). Given these findings, we say that education should focus on high-impact changes that have a greater potential to reduce emissions, rather than low-impact actions that are the current focus of high school science textbooks and government recommendations.
 
The research is meant to guide those who want to curb their contribution to the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, rather than to instruct individuals on the personal decisions they make. 
 
Here are the published findings: [http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541/meta](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541/meta)

What is the likely range of possibilities for the trajectory of climate change?,"I believe climate change is happening, that humans are causing it, that it will be a net negative event, and that something needs to be done about it.

What I don't know is how bad I should expect it to be assuming little or nothing is done. What bad outcomes would we be mitigating/avoiding by tackling greenhouse gas emissions.

I heard people say they believe that the warming is slower than expected, that we have lots of time to tackle it, and that even if we did nothing won't start seeing serious negative effects for close to a century. I've also heard some say that we've already passed the point of no return where nothing we do will matter, and that while humanity won't go extinct, essentially we're going to start seeing a lot of the negative effects soon, like in 20 years, and with positive feedback loops we're screwed. I've also seen a lot in the middle.

I'm not qualified to evaluate these claims. All have come from climate scientists, or people who are well-versed in climate science. So, what's a reasonable range of climate change outcomes?

Why are scientists so quick to point to man made climate change as the cause of the hot temperatures when our temperature records are such a small sample size?,"So, we only have records for temperature and weather dating back to at the most 150 years (actually far less in most places in the world), so why do scientists point to man made global warming as the cause of a global temperature warming trend?

With the miniscule length of records we have, how do we not know that this is just another normal fluctuation in temperature, much like the mini ice age in Europe back in the 15th century?

How do scientists calibrate palaeoclimate proxies?,"Against other proxies which are well established is part of the answer I would guess, but I'm thinking specifically of a sentence I read regarding the Mg/Ca proxy for past sea-surface temperatures:

*Various attempts to calibrate foraminiferal Mg/Ca ratios with temperature, including culture, trap and core-top approaches have given very consistent results although differences in methodological techniques can produce offsets between laboratories...*

I can guess at what culture and core-top calibrations are, although it would be nice to hear from someone who could explain the details of how that works. Trap calibration I have no idea what that means. 

Also, I was listening to an interview where a scientist mentioned controversies with this proxy, were they just referring to the offsets produced by different methodologies? Or are there other complications using Mg/Ca?




EDIT: I'm really enjoying reading the responses from people who work with proxies. I'm an undergrad with a rough idea of the science who would love to get into it properly. 

Some of the other responses in this thread want more background or texts to read on the subject, the podcast [Warm Regards](https://soundcloud.com/warmregardspodcast) has an episode from August 'Climate Forensics', which is a short chat on the use of proxies, doesn't require any prior knowledge.

The oceans cover more than 70 percent of the planet and hold the key to many critical challenges facing science and society, from sustainably feeding human populations to addressing the impacts of climate change to protecting vulnerable marine species.

One of the cornerstone methods of keeping tabs on the oceans is through innovative tools and technologies to monitor them. At Scripps Oceanography we contribute to several ocean observation systems and networks that relay critical data about the seas and how they are changing. These include networks just off our populated coastlines (Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System, (http://www.sccoos.org/)) for applications as diverse as marine operations, coastal hazards, and ecosystems, to far out at sea where it's not easy to access information (Argo, (http://argo.ucsd.edu/)) to help us understand phenomena such as El Niños and ocean warming.

I look forward to answering your questions about ocean observations between 12 and 1 EST on Tuesday, 21 June! Ask Me Anything!

"""Greenhouse gas levels highest in 3 Million years"". Okay… So why were greenhouse gases so high 3 million years ago?","Re:

http://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/greenhouse-gas-levels-highest-in-3m-years-20130428-2imrr.html

Carbon dioxide concentrations in the Earth's atmosphere are on the cusp of reaching 400 parts per million for the first time in 3 million years.

The daily CO2 level, measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, was 399.72 parts per million last Thursday, and a few hourly readings had risen to more than 400 parts per million.

''I wish it weren't true but it looks like the world is going to blow through the 400 ppm level without losing a beat,'' said Ralph Keeling, a geologist with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in the US, which operates the Hawaiian observatory.

''At this pace we'll hit 450 ppm within a few decades.''

"AskScience AMA Series: Scientists are on board the R/V JOIDES Resolution for two months to drill in four different sites along the eastern coast of Africa to study one of the largest “rivers in the sea” and its implications on past climate, Ask Us Anything!","The International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) conducts scientific ocean drilling expeditions throughout the world’s oceans in search of clues to Earth’s structure and past. The current expedition is Expedition 361: Southern African Climates, aboard the U.S. vessel for scientific ocean drilling, the JOIDES Resolution (www.joidesresolution.org). The Agulhas Current carries an enormous quantity of really salty, really warm water southward along the east African coast.  Most of this water flow curls back around at the southern tip of Africa to stay in the Indian Ocean, contributing indirectly to the monsoon season.  However, 20-25% of the current leaks westward into the southern Atlantic Ocean in massive swirls, known as the Agulhas rings.  The heat dissipates quickly, but the salt remains, keeping the surface salinity relatively high.  High salt content causes high water density, and this slightly denser water can make its way into the North Atlantic via the Gulf Stream, where it eventually cools further and sinks, transporting more water northward and maintaining the global conveyer belt of ocean currents in a process that is known to influence northwest European and global climate change.


Recent studies point to an increase in Agulhas leakage over the last 30 years or so, caused primarily by human-induced climate change.  This discovery is important, because it suggests that increased Agulhas leakage could help maintain the Atlantic conveyor circulation, at a time when warming and accelerated freshwater input into the North Atlantic (from the melting Greenland ice sheet) has been predicted to weaken it.
Likewise, paleoceanographic studies also provide exciting evidence from sediment cores suggesting that leakage from the Agulhas Current - in other words, the exchange of warm salty water between the Indian and Atlantic - has been involved in large global climate swings over the past 100,000 years.  The most recent example is the drastic global warming that occurred after the last ice age.


By examining Expedition 361 sediment cores in detail, we expect to find evidence of how the Agulhas Current has influenced the regional and global climate over much longer timescales of the Plio-Pleistocene (0-5 million years ago), and therefore detail how connections within the climate system operate.  This has implications for understanding how the future climate system may operate in a warming world.


A team of 30 scientists from around the globe are on board for two months to work on these questions. Hand-in-hand with the amazing technology required to drill deep into the ocean floor, we are collecting the core samples that hold clues to answer these questions.

Join us to ask us anything about this intriguing science, how we got here, what we hope to discover, and our lives on board the ship!

"AskScience AMA Series: I’m Stephan Lewandowsky, here with Klaus Oberauer, we will be responding to your questions about the conflict between our brains and our globe: How will we meet the challenges of the 21st century despite our cognitive limitations? AMA!","Hi, I am Stephan Lewandowsky. I am a Professor of Cognitive Psychology at the University of Bristol. I am also affiliated with the Cabot Institute at the University of Bristol, which is an inter-disciplinary research center dedicated to exploring the challenges of living with environmental uncertainty. I received my undergraduate degree from Washington College (Chestertown, MD), and a Masters and PhD from the University of Toronto. I served on the Faculty at the University of Oklahoma from 1990 to 1995 before moving to Australia, where I was a Professor at the University of Western Australia until two years ago. I’ve published more than 150 peer-reviewed journal articles, chapters, and books.


I have been fascinated by several questions during my career, but most recently I have been working on issues arising out of the apparent conflict between two complex systems, namely the limitations of our human cognitive apparatus and the structure of the Earth’s climate system. I have been particularly interested in two aspects of this apparent conflict: One that arises from the opposition of some people to the findings of climate science, which has led to the dissemination of much disinformation, and one that arises from people’s inability to understand the consequences of scientific uncertainty surrounding climate change.


I have applied my research to both issues, which has resulted in various scholarly publications and two public “handbooks”. The first handbook summarized the literature on how to debunk misinformation and was written by John Cook and myself and can be found here: http://www.skepticalscience.com/Debunking-Handbook-now-freely-available-download.html. The second handbook on “communicating and dealing with uncertainty” was written by Adam Corner, with me and two other colleagues as co-authors, and it appeared earlier this month. It can be found here: 

http://www.shapingtomorrowsworld.org/cornerUHB.html.  


I have also recently published 4 papers that show that denial of climate science is often associated with an element of conspiratorial thinking or discourse (three of those were with Klaus Oberauer as co-author). U.S. Senator Inhofe has been seeking confirmation for my findings by writing a book entitled “The Greatest Hoax: How the global warming conspiracy threatens your future.”
 

I am Klaus Oberauer. I am Professor of Cognitive Psychology at University of Zurich. I am interested in how human intelligence works, and why it is limited: To what degree is our reasoning and behavior rational, and what are the limits to our rationality? I am also interested in the Philosophy of Mind (e.g., what is consciousness, what does it mean to have a mental representation?)


I studied psychology at the Free University Berlin and received my PhD from University of Heidelberg. I’ve worked at Universities of Mannheim, Potsdam, and Bristol before moving to Zurich in 2009.  With my team in Zurich I run experiments testing the limits of people’s cognitive abilities, and I run computer simulations trying to make the algorithms behave as smart, and as dumb, as real people.


We look forward to answering your question about psychology, cognition, uncertainty in climate science, and the politics surrounding all that. Ask us almost anything!

**Final update (9:30am CET, 28th July)**: We spent another hour this morning responding to some comments, but we now have to wind things down and resume our day jobs.

Why fear global warming/climate change?,"I believe in climate change, and I believe human actions contribute to it.  I am wondering why it should be so high on the list of concerns for people.  It appears that the direct health effects of pollution or the uncertainty of our food sources or a vast number of other things present more of a threat to human and animal life on earth.  Carbon dioxide is the most harmless waste product that humans produce.  I am aware that ice will disappear, oceans will rise, extreme weather conditions will occur, poor people will starve from droughts and floods, cities will be flooded and moved, polar bears, penguins, and coral will die, and many other things.  These things suck, but they already occur on large scales and will always occur to some degree.  The earth is constantly changing and requiring life to evolve.  If it gets too warm, can't people just move towards vacant land in Canada, Scandinavia, and Russia that was previously too cold to farm and live comfortably?  Can't the extra available fresh water benefit the majority of farmers?  In higher temperatures, can't more plant life thrive and produce more oxygen and balance everything out?  Is climate change going to significantly reduce the quality of life of the whole world?

"What are the most important things ""people"" don't understand about climate change?","I am a psychology student currently taking leave from my studies to do a series of podcasts about climate change, a subject I have long wanted (felt morally obligated) to involve myself in, but not been completely certain of how to involve myself in. One part of the podcast series will be asking climate scientists questions, and it is for that part I am putting up this question.

I put ""people"" in quotation marks because my goal is not a question about statistics of what people know, but a question about what people reading this subreddit feel are the most important subjects within the subject of climate change science that people should know more about.

I have friends who are journalists working in radio, who can help me with the story-telling part, and I know enough about editing sound and making websites myself, but I need help with finding the most interesting/essential subjects within the field to work with. And I want the directions for content to come from science-minded people, not journalists.

I hope my question is not too far off from what kind of questions are wanted in AskScience. I put the question here because I am interested in finding out what subjects the science-minded redditors of askscience would like to hear, if they were to hear a podcast about climate change.

He also thinks that the fact that average temperature hasn't increased a terribly large amount in the past decade, even though in the past century it has, is evidence that global warming isn't real, even though plateaus followed by abrupt increases have been recorded.

So, reddit, what unequivocal evidence can I provide my father so he sees the light? (Also, if you think global warming isn't real, and have good reason for thinking so, I would love to hear your input as well.)

Question about climate change from non-skeptic,"I'm a scientist (physics) who is completely convinced that human-caused climate change is real and will cause human suffering in the short term. However I have a couple of somewhat vague reservations about the big picture that I was hoping a climate scientist could comment on. 

My understanding is that on million-year timescales, the current average global temperature is below average, and that the amount of glaciation is above average. As a result the sea level is currently below average. Furthermore, my understanding is that current CO2 levels are far below average on million-year timescales. So my vague reservation is that, while the pace of human-caused sea level rise is a problem for humans in the short term (and thus we are absolutely right to be concerned about it), in the long term it is completely expected and in fact more ""normal."" Further, it seems like as a human species we should be considerably more concerned about possible increased glaciation, since that would cause far more long-term harm (imagine all of north america covered in ice), and that increasing the greenhouse effect is one of the only things we can do in the long term to veer away from that class of climate fluctuations. Is this way of thinking misguided? It leads me down a path of being less emotional or righteous about climate change, and makes we wonder whether the cost-benefit analysis of human suffering when advocating less fossil energy use (especially in developing nations) is really so obvious.

Is acclimatization to a colder climate primarily psychological? Or are there physiological changes too?,"My kids have lived their whole lives in a colder climate than I grew up in, and they seem to be more tolerant of cold, and less tolerant of heat. So when my kids are going around shirtless when the temperature is in the high 50s F, have their bodies ""learned"" to handle that situation differently than mine does? Or have my kids just learned to deal with it mentally?

Side question: I also have some friends who grew up in a warm climate, but who are decidedly ""cold-weather people"". Is that a physiological thing too? Do people's bodies have different equilibria that they regulate toward, with different levels of efficiency? Or is it psychological?",https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/57yajj/is_acclimatization_to_a_colder_climate_primarily/
"If we replaced all black shingles and roofing tar with white or even grey color schemes, what is the environmental impact we could expect?","Black and dark colours absorb heat whereas lighter colors will reflect.  if we seek to adjust our impact to climate change by reducing, among other things, duration of A/C use during hot summer months then how much savings (both in terms of $ and tons CO2) could we expect by theoretically changing all black shingles and roofing to white?

"Considering the planetary changes that Earth will be going through due to climate change, where will the most temperate and desirable places to live in the world be in, say, 50-100 years? Geographically and climate-wise, not politically of course.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/14eejq/considering_the_planetary_changes_that_earth_will/
Climate change knowledge Dudes of Reddit: Please tell me why this isn't being considered as a cause for climate change...,"So, I work at an alternative energies/efficiency firm, and we install a lot of PV, solar water heaters, and a bunch of other stuff.  We also deal a lot with severely reducing energy usage.  This lead me to thinking about how much energy all humans on earth use, which i had looked into before, and found a number that said that in the entire history of humanity, we have used approximately 4 quads of energy.  

I looked again, and found that this number is wrong.  It's closer to 450 Quads, over half of which has been used in the past century.

Then i found a number for how much energy the earth receives from the sun, which apparently surpasses the total yearly human usage in about an hour, 30% of which is immediately reflected back to space.

So, a significant portion of energy used by humans is directly from harnessing the energy of the sun or sent out to space, so if we are really conservative in our numbers, and call that equal to the 30% of the sun's energy that's reflected, then the overall impact of humanity, thermodynamically, is approximately an hour of extra sunlight per year.  Doesn't seem like much, it's actually 1/8760th extra, or .00114% increase in energy.

Now, let's look at the climate change data:

Most estimates that i could find for the rate of global average temperature increase was roughly .14 degrees C per decade, or .014 per year.  I could find a decent global average temperature, but if we use 20 C, or 293 K, we find that this represents a .000478% change per year in absolute temperature.  

So, if these numbers are even somewhat correct, the effect from humans, neglecting any greenhouse effect or an altered albedo or anything else is predicted to be roughly 3 times the change in absolute temperature.  

How have I not seen this explanation researched at all?  Almost all of the energy humans use eventually becomes heat, and we use a LOT of energy.  Please either tell me where i'm totally fucked up, or tell me why this hasn't been addressed.

TL;DR: Thermodynamic analysis of global warming, why isn't it out there?

Edit:  In case someone else didn't know, 1 quad = 1 quadrillion BTU.  And seriously, can anyone shed ANY light on this?  There is no way i was the FIRST PERSON ON EARTH to think of this, and there MUST be a valid reason why it's flat out wrong or being ignored.

Edit 2:  To sum this up a bit better:

I have mathematically predicted that due to stored energy release at a greatly increased rate (burning of fossil fuels and nuclear fuels), the earth is now over it's current equilibrium balance by .0014% per year.  This is roughly the same order of magnitude of the percent change in average global absolute temperature, which is .000478%.  I'm saying there may be a causal relationship.

Edit 3:  lsconv has won this thread.  He pointed out Ed Zachary where i went wrong.  My calculations should lead to a TOTAL global increase in temperature (modeling human consumption as a constant heat source) of approximately .006 K for the past 120 years, not a YEARLY global increase of that much.  Thanks again, lsconv, and thanks to all who weighed in on the topic.

How much would our climate change if the Earth's rotation were to slow by 1 hour?,"Imagine if the earth's rotation were to slow by one hour, leading to 25 hour days. How much of an impact would this have on global ecosystems? What about seasons (as the year would have a fewer number of days, therefore leading to shorter seasons)? Would it have any significant impact on the existing phenomenon generally known as 'Climate Change', or better known as 'Global Warming'?",https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ksdws/how_much_would_our_climate_change_if_the_earths/
Can we solve the climate change issue by sequestering carbon in the soil?,"According to [soilcarboncoalition.org/calculation](http://soilcarboncoalition.org/calculation) if we were to increase the organic matter in the top foot of soil on crop and grazing lands worldwide by an average of 1.6%, we could lower atmospheric concentrations by 80 ppm.

Reports from that page, and others on the site, show examples of farm lands increasing their organic matter concentrations 2x-3x that amount in a matter of years. Is it realistic to think that we could lower atmospheric carbon concentrations by that much through this process? Obviously not every farmer/rancher is going to be able to do this, but if it were possible to provide an incentive for enough farmers to do this, could it make a significant impact on climate change? 

Additional carbon in the soil would also improve it's water holding capacity, meaning we would potentially reduce crop watering needs, which helps address the issue of aquifer depletion also.",https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2qqi74/can_we_solve_the_climate_change_issue_by/
"Typhoon Haiyan has sparked an increase in climate change awareness, but how much do we know about the relationship between hurricanes and climate change?","Since Haiyan struck the Phillipines I have heard multiple times that Haiyan WAS a direct result of climate change.

I remember the IPCC stating ""no single weather event can be directly linked to climate change"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1qdehk/typhoon_haiyan_has_sparked_an_increase_in_climate/
Are there any upsides to global climate change?,"We all know that climate change is resulting in melting ice caps, deaths of some species, stuff like that, and thus we want to reduce those consequences as much as possible.  But, aren't there some benefits to all this?  Are there any species out there that happen to be getting ""better"" due to the climate change?  Maybe an ecosystem that thrives more than it did before?  And with the ice caps melting, new resources and transportation lanes are being exposed; certainly those are worth considering.

I guess what I'm really asking is this:  What are the pros and cons of global climate change, and more importantly, is it possible that the benefits outweigh the detriments?",https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/yb0b7/are_there_any_upsides_to_global_climate_change/

/u/adamsolomon - Hi there. K, so I was an undergrad at Yale (astronomy and physics), did my masters and PhD at Cambridge (theoretical physics) and am now a postdoc at Penn.

/u/Andromeda321 - I am a PhD student in astronomy, currently studying in the Netherlands and hoping to finish my doctorate within the year. I am, however, an American- I came to Europe after a BSc and MSc in Physics at CWRU in Ohio. My current specialization for my PhD is radio astronomy, but my physics background was in cosmic ray physics.

I'm happy to answer any questions about grad school in astronomy, physics, or what it's like to switch from the American system to the European one or vice versa (as they are rather different!). I wrote an (astro specific) article on applying to Europe [here](http://astrobites.org/2014/06/13/how-to-apply-for-grad-school-in-europe/) that may be of interest to people.

/u/AsAChemicalEngineer - I'm a current graduate student at my university's department of physics. I'm interested in high energy research especially in beyond the standard model. I joined in a sort of unorthodox manner and during the academic year and the most important thing I learned from the application process is that almost every problem can be solved by more paperwork and someone's signature.

/u/dazosan - I am currently a 5th year PhD student studying protein biochemistry at SUNY Buffalo. I am planning on moving on to a postdoc by Febuary. I was a poor student in college and thought I didn't like research, so I thought I could make something of myself as a high school teacher, which is how I ended up in Buffalo. Turns out I just needed a second chance at lab research! Ask me anything about grad school, turning a bum GPA around, or what newly minted STEM PhDs are experiencing!

/u/EagleFalconn - My name is Shakeel Dalal. I hold a dual bachelors in Chemistry and Applied Physics from Purdue University, where I graduated in 2009. That same year, I started at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, where I received a PhD in Physical Chemistry working on thin films of organic glasses in 2014. You can read a little more about my graduate school research in [this thread from /r/science](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3hpi70/molecular_scientists_unexpectedly_produce_new/). I'm currently a research scientist at a company in suburban Chicago, working on things only tangentially related to what I did in graduate school. I don't regret going to grad school, but the fact that I couldn't get a job using my already developed expertise is disheartening. I'm happy with what I'm doing now, but I lament opportunities I didn't get, and I will probably be the debbie downer of this thread. AMA.

/u/electric_ionland - I have done most of my higher education in France where I went to an aerospace engineering school to get the French equivalent of a Master of Science in Engineering. I got the opportunity to do a double degree with an American university. After 2 years in the US I graduated with both the French and American MS with a specialisation in experimental fluid dynamics. I am now doing a PhD on ion thrusters in a public research institution in France.

/u/elitemeatt - I am a graduate student at GSU pursuing a MS in Biology. My research focuses on investigating the genetic basis for developing neurons. I am in the process of applying to PhD programs.

/u/Jobediah - I am an [assistant professor of biology at Arcadia University](https://www.arcadia.edu/profile/tobias-landberg). My [academic history](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tobias_Landberg/info) includes undergraduate research on [turtle breathing and locomotion](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10597965_Lung_ventilation_during_treadmill_locomotion_in_a_terrestrial_turtle_Terrapene_carolina._J._Exp._Biol._206_3391-3404), a Masters degree on the [development of escape swimming in salamanders](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227510421_Ontogeny_of_escape_swimming_performance_in_the_spotted_salamander), a PhD on the [evolution of developmental plasticity](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279538531_Evolution_of_maternal_egg_size_effects_in_sister_salamander_species). My two post docs were in far-flung places studying [red-eyed treefrogs](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280493259_Putting_g_in_a_new_light_Plasticity_in_life_history_switch_points_reflects_fine-scale_adaptive_responses) in Panama and frogs and [salamanders](http://phys.org/news/2015-10-smaller-offspring-competitive-environments.html) Western Kentucky. I did an [interview about AskScience](http://beacon-center.org/blog/2014/02/10/answering-peoples-pressing-science-questions-on-reddit-interview-with-tobias-landberg/) last year and [I like turtles](http://www.trbimg.com/img-51ed9343/turbine/hc-ct-snapping-turtles-0723-20130722-001/600/600x490).

/u/liedra - I did my BSc (Honours I) with majors in Computer Science and History &amp; Philosophy of Science at the University of Sydney, Australia, then my PhD in Computer Ethics at Charles Sturt University, Australia. During my undergraduate years and for a year after I worked part time as first line helpdesk support for a couple of companies, then as a Linux systems administrator, PHP/Cold Fusion web programmer, Python programmer, and editor for freshmeat.net, which used to be a pretty cool open source software site back in the dotcom heyday of the internet. Throughout that time I decided that no, I didn't want to become a sysadmin or programmer so I went back to uni and did my Honours year and then I won a scholarship for my PhD. Then a couple of postdocs and now I'm a Senior Lecturer in technology ethics in the UK, where I'm 50/50 research teaching in a permanent position in a post-92 university (which I enjoy a lot). 

/u/noschoolspirit - Hello!

I obtained my undergraduate degree in Geology and Mathematics at the University of South Florida (USF). There, I took an interest in hydrological processes and applied for a Masters at the University of Florida. My masters thesis modeled fluid flow in carbonate aquifers during high discharge events; specifically looking at aquifer storage during floods. This got me interested in the mechanics of flow and subsurface storage, and what effect this had on flood magnitude on a broader scale. I applied to Michigan Tech for a degree in Civil Engineering focusing on water resources to try and tackle this problem. I also developed an interest and helped on modeling projects involving glacier hydrology. I am due to graduate with a Ph.D. in Spring 2016. My research considers:

1. The role of watershed process on flood frequency and magnitude. This involves analyzing the impacts of specific process on stream response.
2. Climate change and the evolution in flood series statistics used to predict floods
3. Karst (carbonate) terrain evolution and geomorphology (including its impact on regionalization in flood frequency analysis)
4. Glacier hydrology and motion

So basically anything related to surface and subsurface hydrology and their interactions.

/u/OrbitalPete - I'm a volcanologist at a UK university. After an undergrad in Earth Science I went off, taught 11-18 Chemistry for a few years, then came back to do a PhD at London. Followed that with a postdoc at the same place, followed by a postdoc fellowship in France. Most of my experience is in experimental flow modelling, but I've also worked in computation modelling on projects collaborating with oil industry partners dealing with submarine currents. In between I've spent a couple of years on casual work while the economic downturn blew volcanology funding out of the water and I resisted returning to the classroom full time.

/u/pengdrew - Here are a few notes about me:

* B.A. in Biology from a small Liberal Arts College.
* PhD in Biology from Top R1 University.
* Dissertation was on Telomere dynamics &amp; Aging in a long lived species. In addition to field and laboratory research, I TAd extensively and also was lead Instructor for an intro course during my PhD.
* Currently a PostDoc at my PhD Institution, currently interviewing in industry and academia.

/u/p1percub - I studied math and biochemistry at Carleton College and the worked in industry (molecular diagnostics) a bit before deciding to get a PhD. I ended up at the University of Chicago in the Dept of Human Genetics for my doctorate and then did a short post doc at the University of Washington in Genome Sciences before accepting a tenure track position at the University of Texas Health Science Center School of Public Health. I have an appointment in the Graduate School of Biomedical Science (a program shared with MD Anderson), and I formally collaborate with Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center. I'm happy to answer any and all questions about training, my time in industry, and all levels of academic training!

She is supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. She intends to go into academia, which is why she is pursuing a Quantitative Psychology PhD instead of a Personality PhD -- the job market is much better for quant, in both industry and academia.

/u/Silpion - I studied physics in college and in grad school, where my research was in experimental nuclear astrophysics. After getting my PhD I decided to leave basic physics and not pursue a postdoc. I am currently in a medical physics residency, training for a career as a clinical medical physicist in radiation oncology.

/u/silverphoinix - I went to school, did my undergrad and am completeing my PhD in UK. My BSc was in Chemistry with Forensic Science, and now I am working in a Materials Engineering department studying Magnetism. I am aiming to continue in academia and have already been in contact with potential post-doctoral supervisors. During my UG I spent my summers working in a research lab for Inorganic and Solid State Chemistry. Basically I have had quite the change in fields! So feel free to ask me questions about higher / further education in the UK, fears of changing research / subject areas, or just what is different about being a PhD compared to undergraduate.

Climate change: Why do we always plot temperature as a function of time instead of the rate of change?,"When debating climate change (let's not get into too much detail here) one common argument is that the mean temperature of Earth has been warmer in the past than the present temperature. This is usually countered by ""it's the accelerating rate of temperature change that's alarming, not the absolute value"".

As the title says, my question is why we always plot the temperature versus time instead of the temperature *rate of change* (i.e., the derivative dT/dt ~ ΔT/Δt). Are there any plots like that available?

----
I can see a few problems with this. For example, in the historical values there are a lot of interpolation/extrapolation going on. If we draw a straight line between two points the rate of change there would be constant. This could be seen as misleading. However, doesn't the same problem exist in the temperature vs time plot when we draw straight lines between points?

Another thing to consider is that it's easier for the general public to understand a plot of temperature over time. But if it truly is the rate of change that's the most important part, I would argue that it's more helpful with a plot that shows how the temperature currently increases at an alarming rate, and it would avoid arguments like the one I mentioned in the beginning. Now I don't know how such a plot would look like - are there other examples in history where the temperature changed very fast?

Is there a correlation between climate change and movement of the tectonic plates??,"Is there a correlation between climate change and movement of the tectonic plates. We talk about how climate change is going to affect the weather -storms, heat waves, tidal erosion from ocean levels rising. Wouldn't these things affect the tectonic plates?? Loss of ice pack, which reflects some of the energy the Sun throws at us, is shrinking due to warmer water temperatures. This means more of that energy is being absorbed by the oceans, which get warmer, and that brings about more melting. Does the shrinkage of the ice pack affect the tectonic plates?? Does water pressure change with temperatures?? If I am diving, am I under the same pressure at the same depth in hot vs cold water??

AskScience AMA Series - IAMA paleoclimate modeling PhD student (and author),"I'm currently finishing up my doctoral work at a major east coast research university, working in the field of climatology and meteorology.  My research involves using climate models (general circulation models, or GCMs) to simulate past changes in the climate system in order to better understand the complex interworkings of the atmosphere/ocean/ice/land system.  Specifically, I've been looking at how Milankovitch cycles (very slow, periodic changes in the Earth's orbit) have affected climate in the past.  Current glacial theory posits that Milankovitch cycles have been the driver of glacial/interglacial cycles over the past several million years.  By influencing how much sunlight different latitudes/seasons receive, Milankovitch cycles, aided by positive feedbacks, can encourage ice sheet growth or decay of ice sheets.  The three Milankovitch cycles are obliquity (a change in the Earth’s tilt), precession (which affects the timing of Earth’s closest approach to the Sun), and eccentricity (which is a measure of how circular or elongated the Earth’s orbital ellipse is).  These features of the Earth’s orbit go through cyclical changes over tens or hundreds of thousands of years.

Please ask me any questions you might have about my research, or about paleoclimate, climate change, or climate modeling in general, and I’ll be happy to answer.

In addition to this work, I am very interested in science education.  Perhaps the best time to get people interested in science is when they are young, so I’ve spent some time to write a weather mystery for kids and young adults, which I managed to get published last year.  One of the main characters, Kelvin McCloud, is a “weather detective” who solves crimes using his knowledge of weather and science.  I hoped that by combining science education with something exciting like a murder mystery I could get kids interested to learn more.  The book is called “Kelvin McCloud and the Seaside Storm”.  If you’re interested, I’m currently doing a puzzle/riddle contest at Kelvin McCloud’s facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/WeatherDetective.  If you are the first person to answer one of the riddles correctly, I’ll send you a free signed copy of the book.

If you’d like to talk about science education or the use of popular media to encourage kids to learn, I’d be happy to talk about that as well (though I’m certainly no expert on the subject).

EDIT: Thank you for all of the wonderful questions!  If I haven't yet answered your question, rest assured, I'm not ignoring you and will try to get to it eventually.

Do hereditary characteristics from a potential father change as he does?,"Sorry if that is poorly worded, but here is what I understand as far as the question goes:

Women's eggs are created while they are still growing in the womb; thus little to no change occurs in the eggs. They will pass on characteristics to their children, but because their eggs have never gone through any change, the characteristics they pass on will be relatively the same no matter when they conceive.

Men create billions of sperm every day (or something close to that). They adapt to new climates, become immune to new diseases, find new addictions, and create new characteristics all throughout their lives.

So my question is, given that instruments have been made more precise over time, how does one correct for the possibility of imprecise historical data? Is it as simple as an ever-decreasing error bar?

My question is: How do we know this increase in carbon dioxide is the cause of the rise in temperature?  Is the answer just ""greenhouse effect"" and that's it?  Do we know that holds on a huge scale, like, well, the earth?

2.) From the statistics I have taken in both high school and college, it has been repeatedly slammed into my head that extrapolating data/models into the future is an very inexact science, at best.  How do we know the current trends in temperature will continue?  Carbon dioxide will continue to increase, for obvious reasons, but if it is causing the warming, how do we know it won't hit diminishing returns?

Something I do not fully understand about Global Climate Change.,"From what I understand the principals behind the idea of human-caused climate change are that carbon fuels, which are currently buried, are being burned and released as gasses which cause a greenhouse effect and heat the planet.
These fossil fuels came about by plants absorbing the carbon from the air, and then dying and getting buried for millions of years.
So why would the planet be any less habitable than when life first arose, if all we are doing is putting the carbon back into the air where it came from?

Is climate change related to heat capacity of combustion product gases relative to the starting gases?,"I have generally good knowledge of chemistry, but I am beginning to think that I have understood the mechanism of climate change and greenhouse gases incorrectly from the beginning.  I may have just learned the wrong thing early on and never looked back.  Here's how I understand greenhouse gases.  Let's think about combustion in its simplest form: coal combustion.  C (s) + O2 (g) -&gt; CO2 (g).  The gas we started with was O2, and we exchanged one O2 mole for one CO2 mole.  I always just assumed that CO2 must have a lower heat capacity than O2.  Therefore, when the sun's (relatively constant) energy hits a mole of CO2, it is able to warm it up more than it would be able to warm up the mole of O2 that existed before.  Hence, the temperature rises.  After looking at a heat capacity table, a mole of CO2 has a higher heat capacity than a mole of O2, so this turns my whole understanding upside down.  Does a gas' quality of being a greenhouse gas have anything to do with its heat capacity, or are they completely unrelated qualities?

"How much progress has been made in identifying the ""missing"" carbon sink in the last few years?","I remember from an undergraduate ecology course I took in 2012 that there is an apparent deficit between projected and measured CO₂ levels in the atmosphere and oceans.

As I understand it, these projections were based on known and predicted amounts of CO₂ emissions from both anthropogenic and nonanthropogenic means as well as projected and measured rates of sequestration into terrestrial and oceanic carbon sinks, but if I recall correctly the difference between projected and measured values was massive and getting larger by the year (without any adjustment to the models).

I mean, I assume it's not just one thing. Speculating as a grad student in biochemistry (and probably over-simplifying), I wonder if it's not a Le Chatelier-like effect shifting the rate of biotic and abiotic sequestration reactions as the concentration of free CO₂/HCO₃⁻ goes up (or, alternately, an allosteric mechanism), but I assume people who specialize in that field have made efforts to account for that already.

Is plant growth ever limited by CO2 availability? ,"First, I'm not a global warming denier! I know that this reasoning was advanced by oil companies to put a positive spin on CO2 emissions.

---

It's amazing what a small part -- 0.039% -- of the atmosphere is CO2, especially after reading on Reddit that most of the dry mass of plants is pulled out of the atmosphere, not the ground.

So do plants benefit from having CO2 more readily available? I did check Wikipedia and found this:
""Plants can grow up to 50 percent faster in concentrations of 1,000 ppm CO2 when compared with ambient conditions, though this assumes no change in climate and no limitation on other nutrients.[44] Some people (for example David Bellamy) believe that as the concentration of CO2 rises in the atmosphere that it will lead to faster plant growth and therefore increase food production.[45] Recent research supports this position: elevated CO2 levels cause increased growth reflected in the harvestable yield of crops, with wheat, rice and soybean all showing increases in yield of 12–14% under elevated CO2 in FACE experiments.[46][47]""
from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide#Photosynthesis_and_carbon_fixation

So does this mean that plants will help mitigate increasing CO2 concentrations by pulling increasing amounts of CO2 out of the atmosphere? Do climate models already take this into account?

How likely is a runaway greenhouse effect on planet Earth?,"I read [this summary](http://www.sindark.com/2010/02/04/is-runaway-climate-change-possible-hansens-take/) of James Hansen's argument that a runaway greenhouse effect on planet Earth can not be fully discounted.

[His argument is as following:](http://www.sindark.com/2010/02/04/is-runaway-climate-change-possible-hansens-take/)

&gt;Some people take comfort from the fact that there have been times in the history of the planet when greenhouse gas concentrations were much higher than now. The world was very different, but there was no runaway greenhouse and life endured. James Hansen devotes the entire tenth chapter of Storms of My Grandchildren to considering whether this assessment is valid. Three things give him pause:

    The sun is brighter now than it was during past periods with very high greenhouse gas concentrations. The 2% additional brightness corresponds to a forcing of about 4 watts per square metre and is akin to a doubling of CO2 concentrations.
    For various reasons, the greenhouse gas concentrations in past hot periods may not have been as high as we thought.
    We are introducing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere far more quickly than natural processes ever did. This might cause fast (positive) feedback effects to manifest themselves forcefully, before slower (negative) feedback effects can get going.

&gt;He also explains that the sharp warming that took place during the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) were not caused by fossil fuels (which remained underground), but rather by the release of methane from permafrost and clathrates. If human emissions warm the planet enough to release that methane again, it could add a PETM-level warming on top of the warming caused by human beings.",https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/14gg4m/how_likely_is_a_runaway_greenhouse_effect_on/

We are now releasing the trapped carbon back into the air due to which it's getting a bit warmer. But it's on record that the poles were a lot warmer than they are now overall.

"Climate change, deforestation and the slight cooling effect. Is it for real?","**Preface:** For most of my life I've been a city-dweller, with little experience of ""nature"" aside from of a few days in state or national parks. I believe global climate change is real. I am a scientist by training and vocation (technically, I'm a manger now), but not in the area of climate change.

**Background:**A few months ago I came across [this infographic on climate change](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/). I think it's a fascinating and well-presented view of the contributions to global climate change.

One of the charts in the infographic has to do with deforestation. As a city-dweller, the explanation given makes sense to me, or at least it did:
*""Dark forests are yielding to lighter patches, which reflect more sunlight - and have a slight cooling effect.""*

**The problem:** This summer I've had the opportunity to spend much more time ""in nature"", in a variety of locations, and it has started to challenge my understanding as to what is really going on with deforestation.

In things like cornfields, which are dark and massive, my subjective experience has been that they hold heat and humidity exceptionally well - better than gravel or concrete parking lots, especially a few hours after sunset. Within a cornfield, the mass of water in the air alone is enough to retain heat on that plot of land; it's a crazy effect. During a hot day a cornfield is insufferable from both heat and humidity, and even at night it is markedly warmer, which seems to confirm the idea that light spots hold less heat than the dark spots.

However, my experience with forests is completely different. Despite the fact that many forested areas have green canopies that are darker (in most cases) than a cornfield, the soil temperature, air temperature, and humidity within a North American forest is degrees cooler than the surrounding plains and parking lots. In fact, it is common to be sitting in the parking lot and have the wind shift so that it's coming through the forest, which makes the breeze markedly cooler. Additionally, even 6 hours after sunset the heat island effect causes a white concrete parking lot to stay warm, but the forest is even cooler - which directly contradicts the deforestation claim in the infographic. This phenomenon was so profound that I even started measuring it (though unscientifically - I didn't have the right equipment with me). Plus, I couldn't get on top of the canopy, though I was able to do some measurements over a forested canyon, which confirmed that the air temp over the forest was lower than, say, a light gravel parking lot.

Additionally, I commented on this effect to the old-timers in the area, and they looked at me like I was crazy, saying that the woods is always cooler in summer. After some thought, it seems to me that the absorption of solar energy by chloroplasts might not be accounted for in the deforestation claims. Might the autotrophic nature of the plants be utilizing the solar energy in a way that reduces the overall heating effect? Dark might mean more heat absorption in the strictest sense, but in the case of forests, the dark coloring is supporting a work and energy storage mechanism that results in heat not being radiated back off into the atmosphere, unlike, say, a dark asphalt parking lot, which is simply a heat sink.

Overall, I'm struggling with my subjective experience and rudimentary measurements vs the data I've seen. Additionally, I think I have a semi-plausible hypothesis as to why my experiences might be real. Can anyone shed light on my experience vs the claims in the infographic I linked?

Unintended consequences of alternative power,"Long time lurker, finally made an account to post a question.

Based on the fact that you can't get something for nothing would we experience large scale negative impacts from most forms of alternative energy? The most consistent number I've seen pegged total energy consumption for the world at 145K TWh. If we got very motivated and quickly changed to a ""renewable energy source"" I don't see how we avoid catastrophic impacts unless we reduce our actual consumption. All energy is a limited resource and the renewable resources are part of a balanced eco system. How do you drain our current usage from any of them without upsetting that balance?

Let's take wind power as an example - How much wind power could be drained from high altitude wind farms before you change global wind/weather patterns. Currently wind turbines operate at about 50% efficiency so generating 145 TWh would drain 290 TWh in energy from the atmosphere. As I understand it, one of the primary benefits of wind is in regulating heating and cooling patterns across the world. Could a massive shift to wind power actually make global climate change worse instead of better? When you drain the energy in the atmosphere it would not suddenly replace itself? Am I missing something? 

To much of a good thing or am I overlooking a scaling issue that makes this a non problem? You could (if bored enough) expand this to solar, geothermal, bio-fuels etc


Edit: What if we turned it into a thought experiment. How much power would have to be drawn from the upper atmosphere via wind farms to cause global change on par of exceeding the impact of fossil fuels.

Why are humans so incredibly resistant to stress and changes when compared to most other complex life forms?,"For example, I've heard about fish dying because the PH of their water isn't kept near perfect, or the temperature is a few degrees off.

Humans, on the other hand, seem to be able to weather a wide variety of climates and conditions, and our bodies seem to adapt to a much wider array of abuses and changes. We can go from eating a pure vegetarian diet living in a frigid environment to living in a hot desert and eating a diet consisting almost entirely of meat *overnight*, and the worst we suffer from is a very short period of discomfort before we get used to it.

-Is the current solar maximum partially responsible for abnormally high temperatures?

-I know the solar cycle is 11 years, but that there are also overall trends.  I noticed that over the last 400 years solar activity has gone up and down drastically, and that we are currently at a high point of that activity in general (not just for the 11 year cycle).  Could this be connected to the hype about global warming?

-The last extreme solar minimum (The Maunder Minimum) coincides directly with the coldest part of the ""Little Ice Age"", but I couldn't find anything more than a causal link to that, so I am assuming the same goes for the current situation.  What would need to be done to prove the relationship between solar activity and global climate change, if such a relationship does exist?

-How often does the overall trend in activity change from ""maximum"" to ""minimum""?  The only timeline I found was for 400 years.  Could we be headed for another minimum, and potentially lower temperatures as a result?

-Would another ""Little Ice Age"" severely limit global food production, or do we have the technology to support our current population even under colder circumstances?

"If we were to start using solar power on a large scale, would we be able to slow climate change on the back end as well as the front? (Explanation inside)","This is probably a dumb thought, but bear with me.

If we were to start using solar power on a very large scale, we would certainly be able to slow climate change by reducing CO2 emissions.  This  is the obvious benefit.  But I was thinking, would we be able to slow the heating of the plant by collecting the sun's heat energy and converting it to usable electricity?  For instance, the sea ice melts and the reflective properties that are lost as a result causes warming of the oceans.  If we were collecting energy in solar panels, could there be a meaningful amount of heat absorbed through that process that would have otherwise baked the earth resulting in rising temps?

"When discussing anthropomorphic causes of climate change, why does it seem only atmospheric emissions are considered?","Some of the things I wonder about contributing are the heat sinks created by dams and cities, the changes in wind patterns from cutting the tops off mountains and building mountain ranges called cities in other places, pumping oil ect. out of the ground by pumping in water and so forth. My current thought is about the changes all this activity has on the balance of the planet, is our planet out of balance like a wheal that has had the balancing weights moved around? Is this causing heating in the crust of the Earth from the extra friction caused by the changing balance?

"I don't think genetic modification is a good idea, but not for the usual reasons. Can you counter my argument?","Science can never prove something to be safe. That's not how science works; it can provide evidence of safety, but never proof.

Biological organisms live in an immensely complicated environment, which even if we could fully model, would still be lacking due to chaos effects (in the mathematical sense) causing possible side effects to be missed.

This leads me to the conclusion that we can never fully demonstrate that GM is safe.  I realise that there are all sorts of studies that can be done to improve the odds, but we can never be one hundred percent certain.

This alone is not the whole of it. Life is full of risk, and the potential benefits from GM done well are enormous and suggest to me that if the research is done carefully then society will benefit. However my main issue is that I see little evidence that it is being done safely.

We live in a free-market economy and this has very important ramifications for science that effects the ecosystem.  One of the reasons the free market works is because it allows mistakes to be made without taking down the whole economic system - as a control economy is prone to do. If an enterprise is based on a bad idea then it just goes out of business, and while this is bad for those in the enterprise everyone else carries on just fine. However, science led by the free-market becomes a problem when the product that an enterprise produces has effects that continue even if the enterprise fails.

GM is a classic example of this. Once a GM organism is released into the wild then the whole world becomes a laboratory and there aren't any spares if we mess this one up. If an enterprise that is producing GM products goes out of business because it created a product which resulted in major eco system destruction, then the economy will be just fine, but the damage cannot be undone. 

Free market principles are being applied to GM research, eg Monsanto. Sure there are some safety checks, but enough? It is not in the interest of a corporation to test extensively, but to do the bare minimum possible to get a product to market.  While not great, this would be tolerable if product recalls were possible. But they are not. Unlike faulty breaks on a car, if a GMO starts consuming a whole sector of the eco-system, it can not be put back in the bottle.

The supposed brake on this system is government regulation, but in a world in which global corporations can step around a nations regulations by taking business elsewhere, this system is broken and in the pockets of the very corporations who are supposed to be regulated.

We are already causing massive damage to the ecosystem, such as climate change and a major extension event. This has largely been caused by more primitive technology that wasn't even meant to effect the environment. It is happening due the same reason expressed above - the free market does not prevent damage to the environment. The idea that we have the social systems in place to cope with more sophisticated threats seems absurd to me.

For these reasons I think that the brakes should be put on the application of GM research until we can work out a safe way of implementing it. However I do think that careful laboratory research should continue (although funding issues would obviously arise). One of the signs that we are ready to start applying it would be the ability to engineer solutions to problems we have created with enough speed to prevent the problem becoming a major issue.

I'm writing this because I often feel isolated in this view point and wonder if other people see things this way. It seems so obvious to me that there is a really important issue here, but I rarely see it expressed. Everyone is either for or against. I can't stand the arrogance that science is some magical panacea; it can do harm as well as good. I don't think that taking an oppositional stand against lay opinion is constructive and would much rather see discussion about how it may be right for the wrong reasons.

"Is accelerating Mean Sea Level Rise attributable to 
the rising CO2 levels the last 100 years?","Ok, so I'm trying to be a good skeptical/critical citizen and trying to learn more about this global climate change. However, with sea levels there are some things that are beyond my even most basic grasp.

According to [this graph](http://i.imgur.com/8U7Rr.png) (Mann, Zhang et al., 2008), CO2 levels have been rising drastically through the 20th century, especially through the second half.

According to [Church/White 2011](http://www.springerlink.com/content/h2575k28311g5146/fulltext.pdf), sea levels are rising and the rise is slightly accelerating.

However, the rise looks (!) to have been going on for a pretty long time. Seeing as climate scientists are doing pretty heavy science for most people, I can't even try to analyze the data. But simply looking at graphs really removes a lot of context as well. Can someone possibly explain how rising sea levels are a consequence of anthropogenically caused rise in CO2?

From a SCIENTIFIC standpoint, how far away are we? Sometimes I read these headlines and feel I should be stockpiling ammo, seeds, fresh water, and canned food…

Question: Dinosaur Extinction - what's the deal with that?,"**SO**

The picture painted by popular science is this: dinosaurs were the dominant land animals for millions of years, filling up the entire world's ecosystems from the size of small cats up to much-much-bigger-than-elephants. That leaves insects (like dragonflies) and fish (like sharks) as the remaining animal biomass, pretty much. There was also a negligible population of proto-mammals that evolved at a relatively recent point in evolutionary history.

Then, **BAM**: an asteroid hits, casting the world into an ecological cataclysm of darkness and starvation. The dinosaurs largely die off because they're so big (and possibly cold-blooded?), which allows the mammals (and other furry friends) to grab the torch from their cold, dead, claws.



That doesn't sit well with me...

* in what way were the small dinosaurs not equally well-adapted to the change in climate?

* Were there mouse-sized dinosaurs? 

* How did mammals, marsupials, and monotremes even have a chance to evolve in the first place, in an environment so dominated by dinosaurs? 

* What about the bigger mammals like mammoths and such, were they already present at the time of the impact? 

* If so, how did they manage to survive? 

* What's known about the geography of extinction - the dinosaurs that eventually evolved into modern birds, did they survive everywhere, or just in a corner of one continent, somewhere? 

* Crocodiles? 

* What about the ocean-inhabiting dinosaurs like the plesiosaurs and ichtyosaurs? 

* Did they die out from the same event, or some separate selective pressure? 

* Was it perhaps related to laying eggs on land? 

* When did sea mammals evolve, and how does this fit into the whole story?

Hmm, a lot of questions. It all boils down to this:

**tl;dr: I feel that the standard presentation of dinosaur ecology and subsequent extinction is hopelessly simplified. Please help me build a more nuanced picture. **

What is the contribution of the green house effect on the observed increase in global temperature?,"Sorry if this has been a topic of the past but I feel like I'm still missing something.  In my opinion, these are facts based on papers/articles I've read:

**1.** CO2 levels in the atmosphere have risen beyond historical concentration fluctuations and continue to rise.  Humans are virtually the sole cause of this.

**2.** CO2 in the atmosphere causes a green house effect and is warming the earth.

**3.** The global temperature has been increasing since we started measuring over 100 years ago and has increased ~1 degree in 100 years.

Recently I've had a quarrel with a client at the shop I am working at. He denied climate change so I tried to talk to him about it. I couldn't answer the question you see in the title.


Now that I think about it I am guessing that volcanoes emit volcanic ash, sulphur dioxide and other gasses AND CO2. So the CO2 gets into the atmosphere and it does contribute to warming, but the ash cloud prevents the energy from reaching the earth. Is it correct or am I confusing something here?


Also, another question of his wnich confused me was about the CO2 effect on warming. He said that the if the CO2 blocks radiation, then it should also block incoming radiation from sun. So it would block some of incoming radiation, and some of the earth's radiation and it should even out.

Fresh water and global warming - what is the real problem?,"I know the problem is 'pretty big'. But there are many factors - the oceans will grow by 'x' percent, and the average temperature will grow. But bigger oceans means bigger surface for evaporation, and higher temperature means more evaporation. More evaporation means more clouds - clouds means fresh water...  
I know desertification is a big problem. There are/were lakes that vanished, and enormous areas are inhabitable. We will need more water for plants even where we didn't need it before...  
But there are places where the water is the problem: drainage, ground-water, floods etc...  
So these were the 'facts' that I know... so it seems for me that the problem is more location related. The temperature - climate will change - more drastic-unpredictable storms etc... There will be new - bigger inhabitable areas. This means border conflicts and other things I don't want to touch...  
So back to the original question - will the problem go as far as portioned water or water quota every habitable places on the planet? Or will this problem exist only for the 'in between' zones?

Painting a roof white vs. solar panels?,"A few years ago someone (a scientist, I think) suggested we all paint the roofs of our houses and buildings the color white in order to reflect sunlight back off of the earth (the way our ice does now).

However, roofs also would seem to be a mostly ideal place to put solar panels, which I assume could help slow down global warming if done on a large enough scale.

&gt;Ostro began noticing a pattern of what's called increasing atmospheric *thickness*. In other words, the vertical distance between the Earth's surface and various higher levels of the atmosphere (identified by their atmospheric pressure) was growing. 

&gt;With increasing heat, the atmospheric ridges of high pressure (regions in which air is falling, rather than rising) were higher, taller, on average. ""The frequency of these really strong ridges of high pressure aloft, these anomalous high pressures aloft are increasing,"" Ostro explains—with profound consequences.

&gt;Strong high pressure ridges are tough to alter. They're persistent, and so is the weather that accompanies them. It could be a long heat wave; or it could be rain or snow for days on end. ""The crazy snow in China, the cold in parts of Europe and Asia this winter, and extreme flooding, and heat waves, it's driving all of that,"" Ostro says. The outcomes are variable—but the extremes are often powerful enough to have dramatic consequences in terms of human lives and also economic losses.

Why is dendroclimatology regarded as a valid way to determine past temperatures?,"From what I can tell, Dendroclimatology is a way to determine temperatures between the period from 1600-1950.

According to Kary, the temperature has only increased during the night, and the potential cause is the growing amount of concrete and building materials creating local heat islands near testing equipment. The greenhouse gas model would supposedly predict that we should measure an increase in temperature during the day as well as the night (Kary claims there is no observed increase during the day). Can anyone confirm this? I'd imagine that at least recently we've collected our temperature data pretty accurately, but I'm not sure about the past 100 years and how this could potentially skew our models of climate.


Additionally, he argues that two papers titled [""Evidence for Large Decadal Variability in the Tropical Mean Radiative Energy Budget""](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/295/5556/841.abstract) and [""Evidence for Strengthening of the Tropical General Circulation in the 1990s""](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/295/5556/838.abstract) contradict the predictions of the greenhouse gas theory. This is a pretty big claim, and I haven't been able to find any satisfactory replies to this argument. I know that these articles were published in 2002, so they are quite old, and although I have access to scientific papers don't feel like I can properly understand and evaluate their findings without guidance from someone in the field.

Are all of the fossil fuels on and in earth made up of carbon dioxide that was once in the atmosphere?,"I know that this may seem like trolling, but it is something that I have been thinking about since the 3rd year of my science degree. As this is such a politically charged subject, I want to make it clear that I am not trying to dispel human-caused climate change, but ask a question that I came up with while I was pondering the issue.

I am going to make some jumps in logic, feel free to address or debunk them. My degree is in Natural Resource Sciences, and we learn very little about the metabolic pathways of microorganisms.

It is my understanding that the source for all carbon in living organisms is from the atmosphere. Therefore, all of the fossil fuels also originated from the atmosphere (as they have an organic source). Does this mean there is a possibility that all organic carbon was once carbon dioxide that was once present in the atmosphere at one time? (this is assuming that non-organic carbon cannot become carbon dioxide). Do we know the conditions of the earth when the organisms that now make up coal and oil grew?

What exactly are the weather/storms like on Uranus?,"So right now I am preparing to teach a lesson next week to 6th graders about the earth's tilt.  One assignment I was thinking about giving was little research activity about how the seasons, climate, and weather of differ on the other planets in the solar system.  However in making sure this was a far research project, I am come to understand that our understanding of Uranus weather has vastly change since when I was taught astronomy. 

When I was taught about uranus in my undergraduate solar system class, I learn that it had very little weather and was mostly calm.  This was based on the data from Voyager 2 probe,  which surprised astronomers at the time because they expect Uranus to have wild weather with such an extreme axial tilt and difference in heat between the two sides.

I have learned that we now have new research from the Keck observatory and Hubble about Uranus having massive storms of slightly mysterious nature (due to when they occured).  This brings me to my question.  I am hoping you guys can clarify what we now know about Uranus's weather and storms.

"Why does adding CO2 to the atmosphere prevent some heat from radiating into space (warming the Earth), but does not reflect a similar amount of energy that arrives at the Earth from the Sun (cooling the Earth)?","This is the cornerstone of any climate change argument - human contributions of CO2 to the atmosphere insulate the Earth like a blanket and cause global average temperatures to increase.

I used to think they changed based on the weather (maybe air pressure, humidity or something), because where I previously lived the weather changed rapidly all the time. However since moving to a new climate the weather has stayed pretty much constant and yet they seem to change even more often.

"Is it possible that ""global warming"" theory is either unprovable or unproven?","Serious science question.

If you look at [this chart](http://www.john-daly.com/stations/WestPoint-NY.gif), comparing almost 200 years of temperature data between two locations only 50 miles apart, you will see the obvious ""urban heat island effect"" that causes weather stations to record hotter temperatures due to increasing human development in certain areas (The ""urban"" designation is something of a misnomer, as a weather station can easily be [affected by suburban land-use changes as well](http://gallery.surfacestations.org/main.php?g2_itemId=617)).

Now, the surface temperature data compiled by GISS, CRU, and others is based on this biased data. Instead of throwing out the stations affected by UHI, they simply adjust the data with computer programs. Is this good science?

Then they take that data and feed it into climate modeling computer programs. So we have data that has already been tweaked and now they are running simulations based on it, so you're going to have problems with correlations due to the adjustments. Right? I mean, how are these climate models not just fancy data-mining for the ""right"" results?

Furthermore a model that is focused on the effects on carbon dioxide will show, who would have guessed it, large effects of carbon dioxide! In fact I understand that some of the models introduce exponential ""feedback"" effects that, depending on the variables entered, will cause the model to spin out of control! How does this model accurately depict reality.

Now, this first part of my question deals solely with the surface temperature record, the CO2 concentration record, and the attempts made to model the relationship on a worldwide level. That is part of the theory of global warming: The idea that you can model the relationship between temperature and CO2 for the last 100 years, and find not just a correlation between the two, but actual cause and effect.

I think that area of the science needs to recognize the limitations of computer models and not suggest that the models are actually speaking about reality. It looks more like data-mining to me.

That gets to the second, more interesting question regarding the theory of anthropogenic global warming: Is the current climate significantly warmer, geologically speaking, than the climate of the past X years (Where even the decision about what X should be seems like an important scientific question)? 

When you ask this question, you are really posing a Popperian theory of reality. Karl Popper famously explained, ""In so far as a scientific statement speaks about reality, it must be falsifiable; and in so far as it is not falsifiable, it does not speak about reality.""

So in order to ask the question properly, first you need to have a ""null hypothesis"" that accounts for the natural variation in climate across the Earth's geological history. Do we include the ice age cycle as part of that? Do we look at just the past 100 years, 1000 years, 10,000? 100,000? Then what data sources do you use, and how could you possibly compare reconstructions of past temperature to surface station data from modern times (Assuming it has not been corrupted by UHI effects)?

Then, assuming the two data sets (the reconstruction and the measured data) are comparable, what standard would you have to set to be sure that the difference is significant?

All in all, I don't see how this science matches up to normal hard sciences, where you can run experiments and get a reliable answer about the state of reality. Where am I mistaken here?
